[name="Nurturer"]Only half of the non-Sankta have successfully acquired halos. I will ask the patrol to have them reconvene right away—

Like the cracking of bamboo, the explosion reverberates out from the depths of the shrine. The peal of a bell from parts unknown drowns out the chimes of the comfort bells. Chaos reigns as countless people flock to the exit.
The towering edifice sways as the blast wave finally reaches the Hall of Enlightenment.

[name="Matriarch"]No. What is collapsing is not only the shrine, but also the answer we sought with it.

The wind. Amidst the chaos, she hears the sound of the wind clearly from above her head, where there should only be praying statues and spotless stained glass.

The Matriarch lifts her head. She cannot see who is approaching her, but her voice has an infectious quality to it. Almost instinctively, she stretches out her arm.
[name="Exusiai"]I've been hanging onto this window for two hours already! If you don't get off that stage, my arms are gonna fall off!
Exusiai holds on tight to the Matriarch. The world spins, and the two of them tumble to the floor.
What they fall onto is not solid ground, but rather some odd softness. It is like falling into fog, yet also like falling into water.
Exusiai senses a great force pushing her outwards, one that is definitely not just the explosion. Could this frail-looking woman really be that strong?
She forces herself to open her eyes. She isn't sure when it happened, but the arm she is holding onto has become the jagged limbs of a beast. The Matriarch's gentle face has disappeared under the water.
They look at one another across the boundary between truth and lies. On her side of the line, the bell atop the Tower of Revelations rings, clear as can be.
[name="Exusiai"]...
[name="Exusiai"]I did figure you weren't as pretty as you looked early on, but my imagination never prepared me for <i>this</i>. Not even <i>Ancient Forge</i> had anything as crazy-looking as you!
[name="Exusiai"]Well, at least I don't have to worry about ripping your arm off!
[name="Exusiai"]My friends had to bust their butts to give me this chance...
