Sculptures of saints line the walls of the small workshop, acting as makeshift display shelves, exhibiting guns to would-be customers in impossible arrangements.
But Amos does not see a single customer. No one stops at the door to the workshop, except for himself. His first feeling is that the whole place seems cold and cheerless.
Not even the proprietor is present. Gazing on the dim light cast upon the sculptures, his second feeling is one of eeriness.

[name="Andoain"]The Matriarch may be blind, but her sense of hearing is impeccable. She caught a faint cry coming from the basement, in the midst of the deafening roar of Originium dashing against the distant mountains.
[name="Andoain"]A mother, lying in a pool of blood in the shadows on death's door. She attempted to intimidate the Matriarch and protect her own child, but all she managed was an expression of great pain.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1800_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Andoain"]I didn't... I didn't even think she would last the night. But the Matriarch had faith in a miracle, as though it was an inevitability.
