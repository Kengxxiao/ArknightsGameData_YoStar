Even in a place like Rocamarea, where everything is washed out by tides of plague and famine, an old man may lick his parched lips and say something to the effect before his eyes close forever.
Words as old as time, as they say. To some, they are an eulogy to wishes unfulfilled; to others, an utterance free of regret. But there is a common premise between the two—
Death is the conclusion to life.

[name="Federico"]I looked you up in the Notarial Hall database after receiving your message.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1032_excu2_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Federico"]Aurela, former citizen ID LC0073458, former captain of the Third Gun-Knights. You were tasked to escort a Lateran caravan through the northern wilderness in the winter of 1090, when you engaged a group of Sarkaz mercenaries in combat.
[name="Federico"]You completed your mission, but the nomadic abbey encountered a small-scale Catastrophe on your way back. The Sarkaz prisoners attempted an insurrection and were executed on the spot, by you.
[name="Federico"]When a fellow gun-knight attempted to record the events truthfully in a mission report, you threatened your cohort with a gun in order to hide your excessive use of force.
[name="Federico"]In the chaos that ensued, you killed your cohort, resulting in you being stripped of citizenship and exiled from Laterano for life.

[name="Aurela"]And what of it, Senior Executor? Are you trying to remind me that Laterano will never forget my sins?
[name="Aurela"]Look at the hundreds of people here. Some are fallen angels who were exiled like me, some are errari who left the Holy City for different reasons...
[name="Aurela"]Some of them have never even seen the Holy City, growing up in a cesspit like Bolívar, yet still believing in the tenets of Laterano...
[name="Aurela"]Have you not seen their halos? Are they fallen, or are they sick? They've crossed mountains and rivers to come here, for an explanation, for any comfort they can find.

More and more errari Sanktas gather, surrounding Federico, pointing their weapons at him.
[name="Sankta Errari A"]You'll keep us out because we left Laterano for too long and forgot how to live like other Sanktas?
[name="Sankta Errari B"]The Law punishes sinners, but what sin did I commit when all I did was live twenty honest years in Leithanien?
[name="Fallen Angel A"]If the Law is that cruel, then it's not us who should be punished. It's you—you and your cohorts, tuskbeasts of the Law!
[name="Fallen Angel B"]I fell because you punished an innocent man! You've never used your power for good!
[name="Federico"]...

Federico watches the crowd quietly.
The street lamps have lit at an inopportune time, casting eerie colors upon their faces. Fear, anxiety, anger, confusion, panic... all these emotions come together to twist their visages.
Their hands tremble as they hold their weapons. The tension is palpable in the air.
Federico is confident he can take out their leader quickly and suppress the rest by force, bringing the situation under control.
He has always done so. It has always worked.
Federico is an outstanding executor. He has been with the Notarial Hall for eight years. He knows what he is doing.
This is his third year as a saint. Other than a burnt flower and a few chance acquaintances, there is no one to guide him or instruct him.

[name="Federico"]...
Slowly, he moves his hand away from the gun at his belt—making sure the tense crowd sees it—while his eyes never leave them.
[name="Federico"]I did not come to repeat the judgment that Laterano once passed upon you.
[name="Federico"]I am not here as a representative of the Notarial Hall, the Curia, nor any other official Lateran organ.
[name="Federico"]The reason you must not enter Laterano is because the city is currently affected by anomalies beyond comprehension. Your presence may cause the situation to further deteriorate.
[name="Federico"]I will explain, but I need time.

[name="Arturia"]The Doctor's discovery confirms our hypothesis. All of Laterano is caught up in some kind of dream, but the anomalies in the dream are being reflected in reality.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_245_cello_1#11$1",focus="m")]
[name="Arturia"]Maybe. I don't fully understand it myself. But there is no doubt that millions of Laterans are being caught in a struggle between reality and illusion, and we need help.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_245_cello_1#11$1",focus="m")]
[name="Arturia"]A chance dissonance is often the beginning of an interesting variation.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1032_excu2_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Federico"]I concur with the Doctor.
[name="Federico"]However, if the calamity has engulfed all of Laterano, they are likely to enter the dream the moment they enter the city.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_245_cello_1#11$1",focus="m")]
[name="Arturia"]That's why I came looking for you. And I brought my cello.
