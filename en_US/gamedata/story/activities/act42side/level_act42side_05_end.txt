[name="Nervous Nun"]It's hard to explain...
[name="Nervous Nun"]A mobile confessional suddenly showed up at the monastery yesterday. Sister Hildegard was lying inside, unconscious...
[name="Nervous Nun"]There was no one else; someone had set the confessional's navigation system to bring her here. We're not sure what happened to her.
[name="Nervous Nun"]Perhaps we can have her report to you once she wakes up.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Gun-Knight"]This is urgent. Bring me to her.

[name="Nervous Nun"]But...

[name="Hildegard"]I'm fine, just a little dizzy.
[name="Hildegard"]I ate the porridge on the table. I'm coughing because some of it went down the wrong pipe.

[name="Hildegard"]Reverend Gun-Knight, you came for Arturia, didn't you?

[name="Gun-Knight"]...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1784_1#15$1",focus="m")]
[name="Hildegard"]Yes, it's true that Arturia left Landen Monastery without permission...
[name="Hildegard"]But I went after her as soon as I found out! And I caught her! But something unexpected happened...
[name="Hildegard"]Please, give Landen Monastery a little more time... no, give <i>me</i> a little more time.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Gun-Knight"]We would like you to come with us, Sister Hildegard.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1784_1#15$1",focus="m")]
[name="Hildegard"]Well... alright.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Gun-Knight"]It would be best if you came too, Sister.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_370_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nervous Nun"]Me?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1784_1#15$1",focus="m")]
[name="Hildegard"]Sister Gerain doesn't have anything to do with this.
[name="Hildegard"]I was the one in charge of supervising Arturia. This is my fault...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Gun-Knight"]No need to worry, Sister Hildegard.
[name="Gun-Knight"]With a major incident like this, the Curia needs as much information as we can get.
[name="Gun-Knight"]Now, follow me, please.
