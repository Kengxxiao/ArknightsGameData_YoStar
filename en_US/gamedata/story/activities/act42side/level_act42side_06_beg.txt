Seventeen giant fireworks burst up into the air as the seventeen-year old red-haired Sankta strums her strings wildly, opening her solo concert. The sound echoes through the campus, rattling the windows of nearby school buildings.
The pews near the stage, statues, and pool... apple pies of all kinds lie everywhere as gifts for her audience.
But the entire square is empty as the red-haired Sankta plays her guitar and sings, with no teachers or students to cheer her on.
It is no rare sight to see a student planning her own graduation ceremony in Laterano, but she is not even at the age to do so. She fails to get her permission to graduate early, even if she has already completed her preparatory courses for university.
But what a sin, to complete them without a ceremonial flair!
Students open their classroom windows and watch from afar as the red-haired Sankta strums and sings without a care, until her final number. Then, they witness an unforgettable sight—

The red-haired Sankta plays her last notes, bows, and thanks the air. The school gates then burst open, as more than a hundred automated confessionals flood into the campus.
Where the audience should have been are now confessionals with their doors open, all their 'mobile electronic confessors' joining the red-haired Sankta's performance with their volume set to maximum.
Neither Laterano's largest choir nor its noisiest heavy metal band could rouse such a racket!
Finally, the Pontifica Cohors rush to restore order on campus. As they persuade the confessionals to return to their routes, however, the instigator has long vanished from the scene...
Leaving only a single banner, unfolding as the last firework goes off—

Exusiai breaks the door open as the confessional speeds up toward her, blocking bullets from the Pontifica Cohors. She hops onto the vehicle, and steadies herself as the confessional wobbles wildly from her landing.
The Sankta's red hair flutters between the bullets and gunsmoke.
