[name="Patrizion"]You must be joking. The cactus tarts were a recommendation from an old friend, a true connoisseur of desserts... what was his name again...?
[name="Patrizion"]Doesn't matter. Back to the topic at hand.

[name="Nurturer"]Just a few weeks ago, they were terrified of these unfamiliar halls. It was a struggle just to give them a change of clothes.
[name="Nurturer"]Now, they feel at home... all thanks to you.

[name="Andoain"]I didn't do anything, except stay with them.

[name="Nurturer"]You're very much like the Matriarch, down to your humility. Just having you with them makes all the difference.
[name="Nurturer"]Was it not your companionship that helped the mother you and the Matriarch brought back through the worst?
[name="Nurturer"]I remember the first thing the surgeon did after leaving the operating room was to check if he still had his halo.
[name="Nurturer"]He could not understand how the mother managed to survive with her baby, after her abdomen was impaled by a spear.
[name="Nurturer"]It was a miracle.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1800_1#6$1",focus="m")]
[name="Andoain"]We'll call it a miracle once she's successfully given birth. Meanwhile, I will continue to care for her as best as I can.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1785_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nurturer"]I'm... beginning to understand why the Matriarch holds you in such high regard. It is reassuring to know that you are in charge of the most important duty of the Nativity, the delivery of the child.
[name="Nurturer"]The Shrine of Nurtury will be ready for full operation if the Nativity goes well. Every child born on Terra henceforth shall have the protection and blessing of the Holy City.
[name="Nurturer"]That will be the true miracle.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1800_1#10$1",focus="m")]
[name="Andoain"]I hope so... I do hope so.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1785_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nurturer"]I must not keep you any longer. Giselle and Romya are still waiting for you!

A procession of halos stretches from one end of the street to the other. No one stops, and there is no commotion.
Someone may step out of the procession to enter a passing confessional, or pick up an ice cream cone from a dessert cart, before continuing on their soundless parade.
Silence and order. This is how things have always been in Laterano, the Holy City.
