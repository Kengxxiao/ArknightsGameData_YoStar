Self-reflection is part of the daily studies of the faithful. As an extension of the Church, there are almost as many confessionals in the Holy City as there are dessert carts.
These mobile public facilities roam the streets and alleys of Laterano, ensuring that citizens' emotional relief is always immediately available.
In the tiny, private space, among the holy sculptures, guns, and pleasant music, a penitent may spill their guts to the electronic confessor.
Sins could range from the shame of consuming too much sugar, to the crime of betraying one's kin or bringing harm to one's people.
After rejecting Federico, the automated confessional ELCARO-001 stops in an alley, opening its door to allow a mysterious guest to enter.

[name="Amos"]...
[name="Amos"]There was an incident a decade ago, when a nomadic abbey was escorting prisoners back to Laterano. A terrible fight broke out between a gun-knight and her cohort...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1783_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amos"]By the time the Curia sent someone, much blood had been spilled, and the gun-knight had fallen.
[name="Amos"]She was exiled from Laterano and has not been heard from since.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1811_1#8$2",focus="m")]
[name="Lemuen"]I've heard of the case.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1783_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amos"]That gun-knight was my wife. It was Reverend Patrizion who led the clean-up task force and exiled her.

[name="Lemuen"]You've been with the Seventh Tribunal far longer than I have, Conclavist Amos. I don't need to remind you of our duty, and the duty of the gun-knights—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1783_1#4$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amos"]No, no, you misunderstand.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1783_1#4$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amos"]I-I'm very sorry. Give me five minutes, I'll try to collect myself, and maybe I can go with you...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1811_1#6$2",focus="m")]
[name="Lemuen"]I don't mean to reprimand you. I just think that this is part of what we do at the Seventh Tribunal.
[name="Lemuen"]We spend our time seeing people we don't want to see, and not seeing the people we want to see. Or worse—seeing the people we want to see in the worst ways possible.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1811_1#1$2",focus="m")]
[name="Lemuen"]I hated handing down instructions to Mostima and the others.

[name="Amos"]But they said you volunteered to join the Seventh Tribunal...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1811_1#1$2",focus="m")]
[name="Lemuen"]Because there's a lot I can do here.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1811_1#10$2",focus="m")]
[name="Lemuen"]The same goes for you, Amos.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1783_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Amos"]Thank you. But I don't really have aspirations. It was like that when my wife was around, and even more so after she left...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1811_1#1$2",focus="m")]
[name="Lemuen"]There's a lot at the Seventh Tribunal that needs doing. For example, there are still several Firearms Workshops that need attention.
[name="Lemuen"]It's our first priority right now. The seizure of the Firearms Workshops must proceed without a hitch in order to prevent any more explosions.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1811_1#10$2",focus="m")]
[name="Lemuen"]I'll leave it to you. Be quick, won't you?

Arturia gazes into the distance.
Behind her, the worn image of the monastery; before her, a golden sea of wheat. The wheat field runs to the edge of the Holy City, and seems to extend infinitely into the distance.
The breeze blowing through the wheat makes nary a sound. Laterano seems to slumber.
