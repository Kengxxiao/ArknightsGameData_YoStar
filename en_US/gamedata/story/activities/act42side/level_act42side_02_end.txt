He has heard the Sarkaz curse in fury, cry out in pain, roar in hatred, even plead in despair...
But he has never heard them pray.
And yet, the pregnant Sarkaz now kneels before a holy statue, her hands clasped together, stumbling over the unfamiliar words of liturgy.
The Matriarch stands behind her, her head bowed in prayer as well, the pair bathing in the warm glow. When the Sarkaz trips over a sentence, the Matriarch waits for her.

She smoothly disassembles it, from the magazine to the barrel to the action to the case ejector...
[name="Exusiai"]I'm not a terrorist, or some kind of super-mercenary. I just know my guns like I know my own joints.
[name="Exusiai"]I remember how I came into possession of each and every gun—yes, ALL of them.
[name="Exusiai"]But the one that left the deepest impression on me was the first one, when I stepped into this little shop, along with my parents and my sister...
Exusiai's hands do not slow down even as she continues talking.
[name="Exusiai"]My sister told me that every Sankta has their very own patron firearm, or guardian gun, the same as we were born with our unique halos.
[name="Exusiai"]So, picking a guardian gun is like making a friend.
[name="Exusiai"]We place our trust in empathy, open our hearts to one another, and learn to get along.
[name="Exusiai"]You were what, four or five years-old at the time? You were tiny, didn't have a halo, and you couldn't even talk. We didn't even notice you.
[name="Exusiai"]By the time we knew you were there, you had your hands on the scope I had picked, feeling it with a face full of curiosity...
[name="Vannini"]Well...
[name="Vannini"]Magister Paganini said he found me in the gardens of an Ecclesia Requietum, and brought me back to this workshop.
[name="Vannini"]I seem to have, er, problems with speech, and he thought I was mute at first. It took a few years for me to be able to put a few syllables together.
[name="Vannini"]I caused him so many headaches. I was never the kind of kid he could be proud of. I sneaked out that day, without even knowing why, and I was so anxious I almost cried...
[name="Exusiai"]Put your hand on it, Vani, just like old times.
[name="Vannini"]Huh?
Hesitantly, tentatively, Vannini puts her hand on it.
[name="Exusiai"]Master Pag put my hand-picked parts together. My mind filled with thoughts when I held it in my hand...
[name="Exusiai"]Protect my parents and sister, make new friends, have the coolest graduation ceremony in Laterano... it told me I could do all that.
[name="Exusiai"]You felt it, didn't you?
[name="Vannini"]...
[name="Exusiai"]The stuff you just said wasn't what I remembered at all, Vani.
[name="Exusiai"]I remember that I picked my guardian gun with a little girl I didn't know. We watched the fowlbeasts across the street, used the barrel as a talk tube...
[name="Exusiai"]She didn't talk, but I could feel what was in her heart when we played together with the parts. That's why I knew she was happy when I saw her reddened eyes at the end.
[name="Exusiai"]This is our secret. That's why I didn't say anything to my sis when she asked if I was bullying you.
[name="Exusiai"]For me, that wasn't the day I made one friend. It was the day I made two.
Exusiai brandishes her gun, which she has already reassembled, and smiles at the young apprentice gunsmith.
Vannini has her eyes fixed on Exusiai, that sense of confidence and pride that was on her face throughout the process.
Vannini cannot tell where the confidence and pride came from. It is almost like Exusiai is saying, 'I'm a Sankta, and this is a Sankta thing.'

[name="Lemuen"]'The prohibition on patron firearms for non-Sankta will be lifted, along with other rules like it.' That part.

[name="Lemuen"]Have greater goals been bestowed upon our arms control work?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4194_rmixer_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Patrizion"]The goal has never changed. All forms of control exist so that everyone will be able to use guns more efficiently, more widely.
[name="Patrizion"]The firearms workshops have a long history, but also plenty of flaws. Gunsmiths and customers both put way too much energy into them, trying to make each and every gun unique.
[name="Patrizion"]Once the Shrine of Gunsmithing in Pagus Michaelion starts operating for real, Laterano will be able to provide armed support to all nations and all races, when we have to.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1811_1#11$2",focus="m")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4194_rmixer_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Patrizion"]Maybe because we're not so great at imagining the future.
[name="Patrizion"]You're right that the Matriarch has bestowed a greater revelation upon me. All will partake of the same revelation at the Nativity.
[name="Patrizion"]When the time comes, it won't be just you and Fia; millions of people will gain insight into the future, both inside and outside Laterano.

In the end, the gathering parted on less-than-pleasant terms.
He had spent much time mulling over Patrizion's invitation before accepting it.
He was not unprepared for what might happen. But with a new dawn about to break in Laterano, he had decided to come and visit old friends, for reasons that he could not, or would not, put into clear words.
What will become of the past once the new Laterano comes?
He wanted a confirmation, nothing more.
The wind brings a cloud that casts a tiny shadow in a corner of the street. Andoain frowns.
He takes a few steps, then stops and waves over a confessional.
