East of the east of La Unidad♪
Laterano, holy city of white♪
There, the earth hides no bombs♪
There, the fields share wheat most bright♪
Abode of our Lord, font of parental love♪
He hears our prayers, He grants our wishes♪
All shall bask in His love♪
Even the legless, even the armless♪
[name="Nueda"]...This might be our last Vespers.
[name="Nueda"]For years, we've tried to keep a low profile in this lawless land, to avoid the attention of the Singas nobles and the thugs who call themselves guerrillas.
[name="Nueda"]But they followed the trail of some escaped convicts, and found our abbey. They're now looking at our farms and burdenbeasts.
[name="Nueda"]Aurela has scouted the area. Tonight, she will lead us through a nearby canyon, and we will leave this place.
[name="Nueda"]We might go north into the plains, or south into the jungles. It will be a long trip, but we've been blessed with a good harvest. We will have enough food...
[name="Bolívarian Child"]Sister—
[name="Nueda"]Don't worry, Hugo.
[name="Nueda"]Trust Aurela. Trust me. Trust yourself and those around you. And trust 'Laterano'...
[name="Nueda"]Keep your voice steady. You remember the last verse, don't you?
East of the east of La Unidad♪
Laterano, holy city of white♪
The guns there shoot fireworks♪
The targets are all apples♪
Through the chapel windows, Nueda watches the sunset. The halos of the Sanktas in the procession continue to illuminate the room, and the choir sings.
She has sung these hymns countless times. It is said that they were first written down by the saints, on their long and difficult journeys, and passed down through the centuries, translated and arranged by Bolívarian scholars.
'Laterano' will protect them through briar and bramble, through the long, cold night.

Perhaps the sun left too soon and forgot to leave some light. The halos and wings of the Sanktas in the choir suddenly shatter, and their light is extinguished.
Nueda is stunned.
Her esoteric knowledge is vast, thanks to the legacy of the K'uk'ulkan, but not a single word or symbol explains the scene before her eyes.
She is so stunned that she forgets to stop singing, murmuring the hymns by sheer instinct. Trembling voices echo through the chapel—
Abode of our Lord, font of parental love♪
He punishes evil and drives out injustice♪
All shall bask in His love♪
Whether they have scars or stones♪
When we pray sincere, He gives us bread♪
When we seek salvation, He sets us free♪
