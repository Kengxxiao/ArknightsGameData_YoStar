The ocean of Originium is endless. Those who look upon it soon realize that every observation they make of it is without meaning.
When everything the eye can see is impossible to differentiate, where to start looking is similarly impossible to determine.
But now, above this great sea of uniformity, something shines.
It is as if the edge of the Originium sea has converged into a river that flows into the heavens. Countless fragments of Originium rise up from the surface of the sea, floating up into the distant, empty beyond in perfect formation.
The fragments are jagged and irregular. Some are as small as dust, others as immense as stars, but all, without exception, are crowned with a glimmer of light.
A glimmer shaped like a ring.

Unease grows, and panic spreads.
Arturia tries to make sense of it all. This is not the same as what happened in Zwillingstürme. There is no malevolent force sowing discord among the emotions of the people this time around.
It is like a movement, one played countless times by an orchestra of the masses, had part of its melody forcibly plucked away, as if it never existed.
Like walking along a road with the sun, the rain, your friends and your home ahead of you, but you are torn away from it for no reason, leaving you feeling alone and helpless...
Alongside millions of your people.

It wavers, revealing the anxiety, terror and worries of the singers... alongside pure, honest longing.
A longing for tranquility, to see night fall in peace and quiet.

[name="Arturia"]I've said before that I can't hold off the apocalypse or overwrite death, and I refuse to lead.
[name="Arturia"]But maybe my Arts can help them stave off this oncoming collapse.
[name="Arturia"]They will let my brethren, free of empathy, to 'communicate' without reservation, purely and honestly.
[name="Arturia"]Go listen to those songs. Go share your emotions. Go tell one another that, at this very moment, in the face of this indescribable loss, we still feel joy and sorrow together.
[name="Arturia"]This has nothing to do with saints and sinners, redemption and responsibility, or whichever path I walk.
[name="Arturia"]This is simply my reason to exist.

Laterano, holy city of purest white, falls into night. But today, there may not be an electrical operator named Alcide there to turn on the city lights.

She decides to play towards the setting sun.
