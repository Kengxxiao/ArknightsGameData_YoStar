You have determined that the momentous migration has come to a conclusion in reality.
That conclusion has been mapped onto the space you are in. The rift that looks as if it has been plowed open by a Catastrophe bisects the plaza in front of the Basilica. By the rift, there is an even more eye-grabbing pit.
Ugly scars in what should have been a city trapped in stasis.
The ring-shaped machine sits silently within.
