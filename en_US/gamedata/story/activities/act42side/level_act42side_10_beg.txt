The K'uk'ulkan thinks back to the past. The gravely wounded nun closed herself off from the world as she sang, until pain and night melted away into her song.
The K'uk'ulkan sings once more this song she has sung a hundred thousand times before. It no longer matters who wrote it, or if the Laterano within it will answer.
She does all she can to calm her nerves so that she can sing in tune. Slowly, the voices of the children join the chorus, echoing out from the room, blending with the distant peals to form a radiant glow.
