A bell tolls.
Its unending peals echo across the entire city. It rings clear and steady, guiding stray souls towards it.
Legend has it that after their long and arduous journey, the saints built the tower and used the ringing of its bell to ward off the devils. Then there rose the Lateran City, its walls of purest white standing fast against the elements, while the bell in the tower fell silent for millennia.
Now it cries out once more, a scant two years since it last did so in response to a mixed-blood Sankta girl's song.

There, floating above the floor of the valley, was a new beginning, one that should not exist in this desolate waste—
The pale, petrified forms of plants and beasts dance among mud, spinning about to some rhythm beyond ken. A string of boulders draws them along as they go, coming together to form a great ring.
[name="'Saint'"]The fragments of the ring pulsed faintly with light. At first, they thought it was fire, but they sensed no heat, and it seemed untangible.

[name="'Saint'"]She looked at her near-mad, emaciated companions, and realized that they all would die of hunger and thirst before the silver mounts awoke from their slumber.

The flow of information does not come rushing in as you imagined. The clamor of computation has faded away at some point. You and Mon3tr feel a peculiar feeling wash over the both of you.
You seem to have stopped at a fork in the road. An old friend appears. Has she been walking alongside you the whole time, or is it a chance encounter? In short, you see her.
The color begins to drain out of your surroundings. It is as if time stands still. This is the stage built for your reunion.
