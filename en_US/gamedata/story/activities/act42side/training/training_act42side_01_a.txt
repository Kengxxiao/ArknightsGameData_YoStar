[popupdialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")]Here is the Shrine of Nurtury. Here, thousands upon thousands of children share in the same sweet dream.
[tutorial(focusWidth=220, focusHeight=220, animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="0.5", protectTime=0.5,\
 dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", tileY=3, tileX=4.5)]This is because of the 'Dream Tiles' installed here, which causes our operators to immediately fall into a dream when deployed on them.

[popupdialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")]We need to wake up our dreaming operators!
[popupdialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")]It may take a LONG time for operators to wake up by themselves...
[tutorial(focusWidth=220, focusHeight=220, animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="0.5", protectTime=0.5,\
 dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", tileY=3.5, tileX=3.5)]Let's have our waking operators help out. We can use, er, slightly <i>extreme</i> measures.
[popupdialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")]Hitting dreaming operators increases their Wakefulness, until dreaming operators are fully awake.
[popupdialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")]Injured operators also gain Wakefulness when they are healed.

[popupdialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")]More enemies are approaching. We need to ensure that enough operators are awake.
[tutorial(focusWidth=800, focusHeight=200, animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="0.5", protectTime=0.5,\
 dialogHead="$avatar_amiya", tileY=1, tileX=4.5)]Look at what the children are wearing. They seem to be playing some kind of character. Maybe they can tell us something if we wake them up.
[popupdialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")]I'll leave the rest to you, Doctor.
