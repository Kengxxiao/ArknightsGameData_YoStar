Comfort bells sway violently throughout the hall. The ever-shifting emotions in the irregular heartbeats tug at everyone's nerves.
No one knows who the mother is, what her name is, how old she is, where she came from... but everyone knows what she is experiencing. No one moves a single step.
The fragile newborn has not yet triumphed over death. The struggle to break through the shell of ignorance seems eternal. Inside the Shrine of Nurtury, thousands of people experience a childbirth together—

It is not a sad sound. It is young and bright.

The Matriarch embraces the newborn life tightly, crying tears of joy. One such tear drops from the empty eye sockets behind her veil, falling upon the fledgling's head, reflecting the light of the sun.
The fledgling does not stop crying. As though driven by the wailing, the light begins to break free of the void's shackles, becoming rich and full—
A halo.
The mark of the Sankta, the symbol of the Law, the embodiment of truth. It has illuminated this unfamiliar creature—
A shining, miraculous beacon.
