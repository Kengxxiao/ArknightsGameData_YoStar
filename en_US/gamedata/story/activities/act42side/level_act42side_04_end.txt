[name="Hildegard"]According to <i>The Saints' Travels</i>, the first encounter between the Liberi and Laterano began with a herd of burdenbeasts.
[name="Hildegard"]Many years ago, a group of Liberi were scattered by a herd of burdenbeasts while seeking water in the wilderness. The animals carried grain on their backs, forming an orderly procession as they traveled into the distance.
[name="Hildegard"]The Liberi spent great effort to hunt the burdenbeasts. They never imagined that these creatures of the wild could move in such orderly manner, so they followed the beasts.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1784_1#2$1",focus="m")]
[name="Hildegard"]Then, the Liberi saw the halo-bearers in the fields, singing as they guided the herd of burdenbeasts into the assembly of pearl-white buildings behind them.
[name="Hildegard"]At a time when the Liberi still lived naked in the wild, seeking water and game, those people had learned to tame wild beasts, and build cities safe from Catastrophe.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1784_1#15$1",focus="m")]
[name="Hildegard"]More importantly, the Liberi found that those people had a confidence and optimism that was alien to the Liberi.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_245_cello_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Arturia"]Because of their halos, and 'empathy'...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1784_1#1$1",focus="m")]

[name="Hildegard"]Even as the Curia cut off funding to the monastery, even as its buildings fell into disrepair, even as I fretted over the monastery's books...
[name="Hildegard"]The Sanktas of Landen Monastery never seemed to fear that there might come a day when we would have to close our doors.
[name="Hildegard"]Their confidence and optimism let them accept the presence of the Liberi nearby, learning from them and becoming part of the whole.

[name="Arturia"]...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_245_cello_1#1$1",focus="m")]
