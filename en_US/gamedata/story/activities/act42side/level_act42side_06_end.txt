To little Vannini, 'understanding' and 'expression' were a pair of rusty doors blocking her from communicating.
She lived with the garrulous and eccentric Liberi for three years, unable to figure out when he was happy or angry, unable to express her own annoyance or adoration.
She never thought a Sankta with both fiery hair and personality would blast a hole into her sealed-off heart without the need for words.
Later, her master pieced small bullet casings together and, word by word, taught her a whole new language. Even after she finally learned some simple phrases, they still used the shells to communicate.
But today she no longer remembers when exactly she did finally manage to grasp the most complex of sentences, let alone how many times she nonchalantly tossed the shells left by her master into the trash.
She dares not imagine his perplexed face as he rubbed the shells they used for more than a decade, wondering why his student no longer cherishes this special language from the depths of her memory.
Through tearful eyes, she realizes once more what those casings meanâ€”it's a warning!

With the gun-knight gone, Amos pulls out a chair. He opens his terminal, and his privileges have indeed already been updated, as Patrizion said.
Everything happened so fast he needs some time to adjust... and he suddenly realizes something.
He taps on the file explorer, and scrolls all the way down, finally arriving at his target at the bottom.
He opens the document, his finger pausing on a signature confirmation page.
