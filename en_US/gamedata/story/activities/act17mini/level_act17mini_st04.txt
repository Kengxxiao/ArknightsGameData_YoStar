[name="Mostima"]Hmm... Where to begin?
[name="Mostima"]A few years ago, on a job in Ursus, I ran into a Sarkaz.
[name="Mostima"]Apparently, she couldn't stand life at home and decided to wander across the lands. By the time I met her, she had just managed to find a path she wanted to follow.
[name="Mostima"]Ursus has real strict controls on a lot of things, so that Sarkaz needed people like us to get her the stuff she wanted.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#17$1",focus="l")]
[name="Nymph"]Was Crownie a designer in Ursus?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_213_mostma_1#7$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mostima"]A designer? Heh, an Ursine hiring a Sarkaz to be an <i>assistant</i> is already a super-nice Ursine.
[name="Mostima"]Y'know, the fashion brand that hired her was actually founded by a Sarkaz, but it got so crazy-popular in Ursus most people think it's local.
[name="Mostima"]Even that fashion freak over there thought so at first. Anyway, she got the cold shoulder in Ursus, so after a bunch more wandering, she made her way back here.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Nymph"]She must have made a lot of money before she came back.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_213_mostma_1#7$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mostima"]Money? Hehe, shame I have to say it, but she's barely got two coins to rub together.
[name="Mostima"]When you look at her, well, you're seeing everything she's got, in a way.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_213_mostma_1#7$1",focus="n")]
[name="Crownie"]The silk's perfect, Mostima!
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_4146_nymph_1#17$1",focus="l")]
[name="Nymph"]Then why's she buying cloth? I've seen where she lives, and the people around her. Maybe she's skipping meals to afford all this expensive stuff...?
[name="Nymph"]Maybe she predicted that the Furnace would explode, and wanted the revenant to latch onto the fabric? No, that doesn't make any sense...
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_213_mostma_1#7$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mostima"]Wowee, that sounds serious.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_213_mostma_1#12$1",focus="r")]
[name="Mostima"]I have no clue what you're talking about, but we should probably head on over. C'mon.

[name="Crownie"]I was offered menial work in Ursus. At first, it was only my survival instinct that spurred me to accept.

[name="Crownie"]In order to understand it, I took up tailoring, alongside the crafting of many other knick-knacks.
[name="Crownie"]As it happened, Kazdel had forgotten me by that point. And so I returned, under a new identity.
[name="Crownie"]Kazdel has changed, just as I have. It's a more tolerant city these days. Even a stuck-out nail such as I can find a stage here.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4147_mitm_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Pohl"]You walked up to the city gates and flew off the walls. The information brokers've been chatting about you pretty much all day.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4146_nymph_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nymph"]Did you find anything?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4147_mitm_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Pohl"]Nope. No signs of fragment influence around the Military Commission garrison or settlement.
[name="Pohl"]You found something yourself, didn't you?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4146_nymph_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nymph"]Yeah! Look! The fragment I found today is super pretty! It's like a gem!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4147_mitm_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Pohl"]It's a piece of glass from inside the furnace, looks like. You're right though, that color is really distinctive.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4146_nymph_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nymph"]The lady who gave it to me was really distinctive too!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4146_nymph_1#13$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nymph"]Today's been real hard on me, though. I was running around all day, and now I'm hungry and tired, haaah...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4147_mitm_1#8$1",focus="m")]
[name="Pohl"]Go home and get some rest already. Just one residential district left to check. Gotta do all we can to get everything wrapped up tomorrow.

[name="Pohl"]Damn, you're so tired you nearly smacked your head against the wall... Fine, I'll walk you home.
[name="Pohl"]Don't fall asleep just yet. Tell me about this 'distinctive lady' you met.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4146_nymph_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nymph"]Sure... I went to the market this morning to buy...
[name="Nymph"]Some baked dough, which smelled real nice...
