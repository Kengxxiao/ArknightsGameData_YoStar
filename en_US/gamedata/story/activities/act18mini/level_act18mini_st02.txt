[name="Ch'en"]But where can you go?
[name="Ch'en"]Your identities are too conspicuous.
[name="Nine"]Is this where you say we should go to Rhodes Island?
[name="Ch'en"]Yes. I have to see the both of you judged.
[name="Ch'en"]But not right now. Many Infected are still relying on you, and I can't just leave them in the dust.
[name="Nine"]Hah... Classic Officer Ch'en.
[name="Talulah"]Want my opinion?
[Dialog]
Whenever Talulah proactively offers her thoughts to Nine, it often leaves the Phidia with even more doubts towards her.
But Talulah has never fallen behind.
She always walks silently in the center of their group, so inconspicuous that people forget she exists.
Reunion's leader, Kashchey's adopted daughter, and the manipulative mastermind behind the Chernobog disaster.
Talulah, regarded as a hero by Infected who do not know the truth.

Her sword begins to burn, and its flames spread across the floor. They jump and fall, outlining a symbol.
The firelight reflects in the trio's eyes, but their faces still bear some gloom—the mark once represented a dark past.
Within it hides all sorts of crimes and injustices, certain to sting if revealed for all to see.

[name="Talulah"]Ursus.
[name="Talulah"]We can go back to Ursus.
[name="Nine"]......
[name="Ch'en"]...That's a terrible idea.
[name="Nine"]What, thinking about your unfinished business over there?
[name="Talulah"]No, I want to right my wrongs.
[name="Talulah"]I've received news from Ursus. The Infected are breaking their shackles and congregating on the tundra again.
[name="Talulah"]They claim to be answering the call of Reunion, and have decided to stand up and fight for the rights and freedoms the Infected and other oppressed deserve.
[name="Talulah"]They were inspired by a lie, but their determination to fight back is certainly real.
[name="Nine"]So they gave you the courage to recall the good old days?
[name="Talulah"]...It's not only Infected over there. There are students, exiled officers and soldiers, guilt-ridden nobles...
[name="Talulah"]It's exactly the strength you need.
[name="Talulah"]Strength that ignores the differences in race or identity and crushes the fear of disease, united by a common goal.
[name="Talulah"]Besides, it'll take time to leave with this many people... and I think that should be long enough for you to explain Guard's precious dream to those still willing to follow you.
[name="Nine"]...You don't want to restore Reunion's reputation?
[name="Talulah"]No. I never expected it to hold such a large influence even today.
[name="Talulah"]Even if the Ursus Empire has long since covered up what happened at Chernobog.
[name="Nine"]The voices craving resistance are like water. They might be burnt and dry up, but they'll eventually return to the land as rain.
[name="Ch'en"]Returning to Ursus is easier said than done. There are too many factors involved, and more things for me to confirm.
[name="Nine"]That's your problem. Not ours.
[name="Nine"]Talulah...
[name="Nine"]Even if Reunion can turn a new leaf, representing once again freedom and happiness...
[name="Nine"]What about you, Talulah? Your sins can't be washed away. Your existence is Reunion's darkest history.
[name="Nine"]How can you face the pure-white tundra as you are?
[name="Talulah"]I know that I stand here today no longer as a leader, but as a symbol, a flag, or even... a weapon to be wielded.
[name="Talulah"]But I'll take it. I'll accept the shackles you place on me. I've had many different identities—Draco, noble, leader, Infected... None of these matter anymore.
[name="Talulah"]Today I remain only someone who once scattered the seeds of sin.
[name="Talulah"]The wrongs I committed in Ursus, I will repay in Ursus.
[name="Nine"]Repay... you make it sound so simple.
[name="Talulah"]I will not act as just a flag this time.
[name="Nine"]Then how?
[name="Talulah"]I'll throw myself into a true blaze and let it all burn, until even the tundra's chill melts away.
[name="Nine"]......

[name="Talulah"]I'll go back to Ursus... to truly face my own trial.
[name="Talulah"]And you can be there to witness it, Nine.
[name="Talulah"]Witness the end of Reunion, and the birth of something new from its corpse. That's what you truly want, is it not?
[name="Nine"]You really don't mind?
[name="Talulah"]The Reunion of my heart died long ago on the tundra... along with my companions.
[name="Ch'en"]......
[name="Nine"]......
[name="Ch'en"]I'll go with you.
[name="Talulah"]Scared I'll harm more innocents?
[name="Ch'en"]Both you <i>and</i> Nine.
[name="Ch'en"]After following Reunion for a while, I can confirm that the group has changed somewhat.
[name="Ch'en"]For good or bad... I can't say.
[name="Ch'en"]I don't want to miss your trial, but I also don't want to jump to any hasty conclusions about whether the path Nine insists on is correct.
[name="Ch'en"]From now on, I'll keep an eye on you as Rhodes Island Operator Ch'en.
[name="Ch'en"]I need to keep Rhodes Island informed, no matter what happens in Ursus.
[name="Ch'en"]Talulah, Nine... I'm responsible for you both.
[name="Nine"]...Whatever.
[name="Ch'en"]Now, you should probably get going. Leave the soldiers to me. I'll catch up after I make sure they're okay.
[name="Nine"]We didn't say we'd wait for you.
[name="Ch'en"]Have you ever? I've always had to catch up on my own.
[name="Nine"]Hmph.
[name="Nine"]Onwards to Ursus then.
[name="Talulah"]......
[name="Talulah"]Onwards to Ursus.

The flames continue to spread slowly from the tip of the blade.
Hot flames lick the bodies piled up in a corner, gently enveloping them.
Amid the light crackling of the fire, Talulah silently prays for the flames to bring them to a brighter and warmer place.
