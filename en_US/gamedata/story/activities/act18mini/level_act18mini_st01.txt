After the battle at Silverrock Bluffs, the Royal Court forces retreated behind Londinium's walls, while Victoria's Dukes kept their forces stationed around the city, in no hurry to assault it.
Wellington's army, with their fresh new flag, did not participate in the siege, and stationed themselves just outside the warzone like an indifferent observer, coolly watching the deadlock outside the city.
But a stalemate does not necessarily mean peace. Scouting efforts and countermeasures, raids and ambushes, Sarkaz witchcraft and brief cannon barrages...
Accompanying them are the curses and groans of the immobilized wounded, unable to do anything but wait in vain for death to come. Everything comes together in a tapestry of stifling tranquility.
