As her finger dips into the blood, a host of information springs up before her eyes. Through this blood, Entelechia communes with the consciousness of the deceased before it disperses completely.

As Rose Riverside's 'cleaner', she has seen too many of her compatriots fallen in pools of their own blood.
The shadows of these grisly scenes serve as elucidators of information in her mind's eye, fitting together into a vague memory.

The memories continue further into the past. A familiar figure steps out of the river of blood, quietly watching them.
It is Trickster's memory, and the memories of all the Canoes. As the warmth dies away in the blood, so too does the memory of the dead slowly dry up.
Not many Canoes have left them, but none left in silence. No matter how dire the situation, they always spared the time to grieve for a lost sister.
At least, they did, once upon a time.
[Dialog]
[name="Entelechia"]No, wait—What about the people we're looking for? Are you really alright with this?
[name="Entelechia"]Didn't you want to bring back all our sisters too?
She sees no information. There is no answer from the blood.
But unexpectedly, her finger touches something solid.

She knows this crystal. Of course she does.
It is a drop of her own blood. A vow. The beginning of Rose Riverside.
There is no information within the pure crystal, merely the lingering warmth of Arts.
[name="Entelechia"]My Princess... Why did you choose to return this to me now? Why now, of all times?
[name="Entelechia"]You were here, so why did you leave so soon?
[name="Entelechia"]Was it because you could not save her? Or was it because of the war that barely ended? Because of all that transpired years ago?
[name="Entelechia"]Or maybe... it's simply to say farewell...

[name="Entelechia"]'Rose Riverside will no longer take part in anything to do with Babel.' A rule I set myself. She would not have violated it.
[name="Entelechia"]Kal'tsit, she may have simply come to say farewell to Her Highness... Or perhaps it was to stop Trickster and I from continuing our search...
