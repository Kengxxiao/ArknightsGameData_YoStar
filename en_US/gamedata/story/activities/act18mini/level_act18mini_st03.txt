The man waves at Nowell with something other than anxiety or panic on his face.
It is a smile of gratitude, with a sincerity that makes Nowell awkward. All he can do is nod and smile back.

[Dialog]

But the man keeps walking until he is right in front of him, and reaches out a hand, as though words alone cannot express his gratitude. And so Nowell keeps the smile on his face and shakes the extended hand, almost unconsciously.
Only then does he finally realize that pain is spreading, from his back to his chest to the rest of his body. He has difficulty breathing and bends down, grabbing his own collar.
The wounds he received from the rubble have still not started to heal.

Clovisia... he had passed right by the one he spent his entire life looking for, without even realizing it.
But it is no longer important. With great effort, Nowell looks up, fighting against the pain and difficulty of breathing.
In his blurry vision, he sees a child clutching his mother's hand tightly. The boy is the very picture of health, his hair and skin a warm color, with a smile on his face, just like...

Nowell falls to his knees, no longer able to support his own weight. It is as though the fatigue of a hundred years of wandering has come upon him in an instant.
Before his hands and feet grow cold from blood loss, he curls his body down, ignoring the searing pain as the wounds on his back stretch, until his head touches the ground.
It is a posture of worship and reverence, but he is not praying to anyone.
He lifts his head after a little while.
