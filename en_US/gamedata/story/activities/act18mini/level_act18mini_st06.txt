[name="Lateran Commando"]Even though the Sarkaz have committed countless crimes within our holy city? Even though Laterano has never before faced such provocation and desecration?
[name="Lateran Commando"]Even though their army is openly threatening the safety of our residents? Even then, we will not respond?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_358_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Apostolic Knight"]Yes. His Holiness believes that Laterano should not interfere in this matter.

[name="Lateran Commando"]I wish to see him. I'm going to file a protest!

[name="Yvangelista XI"]The sudden disturbance of the halo, and the flood of information...
[name="Yvangelista XI"]For whatever reason, it suddenly became aware of something.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]'A conversation'.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]It is... having a conversation. With something similar to itself.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]Since it has decided to make its choice, I am afraid I must follow suit. The new revelation it has showed us is something Laterano can no longer bear on its own.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]Let me think... let's start with the first question.
[name="Yvangelista XI"]...Who are you?

Someone walks into the static void.
He is following someone else's footsteps, although their footprints have vanished from this place forever.
The tower is still collapsing, a hint at everything that has transpired.
Although time has no meaning here, he must admit that he's a step late.
She is already completely out of reach.
Now all he can see is the golden ocean and the lonely diamond in the sky.
