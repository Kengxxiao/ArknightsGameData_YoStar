[name="Ning Shu"]Yu Cheng... That is the truth behind the Grand Preceptor case you seek.
[name="Ning Shu"]Do you have any further questions?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]You've spoken at length, yet you've said nothing about your role in these events, Mr. Ning.
[name="Yu Cheng"]Why did you send someone to kill the Minister of Justice?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Do you not already have the answer, Deputy Minister Yu? Was it not you who accused me years ago of having the Minister murdered to stop him from investigating and save myself in the chaos?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#2$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]You need not be in such a hurry to discredit yourself.
[name="Yu Cheng"]There was one question that perplexed me for a long time. Why did Gu Quan stay at your house when he returned to Baizao nearly a decade later?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]It was not until I saw that girl at your house did all the puzzle pieces fall into place.
[name="Yu Cheng"]He narrowly escaped with his life, yet he still returned to Baizao, not only to find the truth of what happened, but also to search for the daughter he left behind.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]It seems he did not tell you much.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]Yes. Most of what follows will be mere speculation. If I'm wrong, feel free to laugh in my face.
[name="Yu Cheng"]I heard that after the Grand Preceptor's suicide following accusations of treason, the entire nation was in uproar and mandarins distanced themselves from her. Yet, one Academy student dared to honor her in public.
[name="Yu Cheng"]It was thus that he stumbled onto the Grand Preceptor's home as the belongings within were being confiscated. In his hurry, all he could take away was a baby girl, just born into the family. As it so happened, his own daughter was recently born as well.
[name="Yu Cheng"]At his wit's end, he tried to flee Baizao with his wife and the two babies. As a scholar with no background, he didn't get far before an Imperial Guard captured him.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#3$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]Perhaps out of compassion and wanting to keep the Grand Preceptor's bloodline going, the Imperial Guard spared the scholar and the Grand Preceptor's child, instead taking the scholar's daughter.
[name="Yu Cheng"]I do not know what Gu Quan was thinking at the time, but it was most likely he had no other choice.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]This child fell into the hands of the Minister of Justice, her bloodline obvious with a modicum of research. But as it turned out, how to handle this child of an outsider was a delicate conundrum indeed.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]It was around this time that you, Mr. Ning, long dissatisfied with the Minister's extreme methods, decided to take the ultimate risk: assassination.
[name="Yu Cheng"]The Grand Preceptor's case implicated many, and it seemed fitting that the bloodstained Minister of Justice met his end through retribution. With the court's turmoil resolved, the True Lung allowed the bloodstained curtain to finally fall in this fashion.
[name="Yu Cheng"]The only unresolved question left is that child. Based on how things are now, she was taken into your care. What this entailed is not hard to guess. But as for the why of it...
[name="Yu Cheng"]If I recall correctly, Mr. Ning, you enjoyed the tutelage of the Grand Preceptor as well, correct?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]O Yu Cheng, had you not been absorbed in Judicial work or confined to this cell, I shudder to think what that meticulous mind of yours might have accomplished.
[name="Ning Shu"]It's terrifying, truly terrifying.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#3$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]You flatter me. I'm nothing more than a fool compared to Gu Quan. It is simply because I have met far too many people in my capacity as Deputy Minister of the Judicial Review Office. The more one sees, the more one learns.
[name="Yu Cheng"]Now that I think about it, the dish Gu Quan offered to the True Lung at the Feast of a Hundred Delicacies wasn't merely an act of suicide—it was him reconciling with the truth.
[name="Yu Cheng"]Before he passed, he did not tell me the truth, but he did divulge the whereabouts of the Grand Preceptor's orphan. He must have hoped that once I found the truth for myself, I would also choose reconciliation.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]Yet I could not.
[name="Yu Cheng"]All I could do was use my methods to find the people still left, the ones you care for, and force you to spit out the truth.
[name="Yu Cheng"]All things considered, Mr. Ning, you are no villain, perhaps just a coward...
[name="Yu Cheng"]Hate me all you want.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]...
[name="Ning Shu"]To see that child once more has always been a wish of mine...
[name="Ning Shu"]I will go and seek an audience with His Majesty.

[name="Blaze"]But never one that demanded a lifetime of commitment, one that cost him his own daughter and himself, all to protect someone who had nothing to do with him.
[name="Blaze"]How... How could he be so stupid?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#9$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Yin"]It reminds me of a story I once read...
[name="Ning Yin"]There once was a guard who watched over a rest station by the river. One day, he saw a flood coming from upstream. He wanted to run upstream and tell the people there to close the sluice gates.
[name="Ning Yin"]But he had only run halfway when he saw the river was rising too quickly. It was too late to close the gates. So he immediately decided to turn and warn the villagers downstream to flee.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#2$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Yin"]Back and forth he ran, until finally he was consumed and swept away by the flood. He didn't manage to do anything or save anyone.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#12$1", focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]Get to the point already...
