Blaze has done these sort of high-altitude leaps countless times before as a form of dynamic entry into the battlefield, or wherever happened to need her.
She has never once felt fear. She believed in her own strength, and in her many friends.
There was never any confusion in her mind either. She knew who she was. She knew where she must go. She knew what she believed in.
There is no plot that can hold back her heat, just like how the mist of dawn cannot hide away the sun.
But now?
What awaits her is no longer solid ground, but an endless abyss.
She closes her eyes.

[name="Young Chef"]Oh, finally awake I see.
[name="Young Chef"]I knew you were one tough Feline. Look at you, as lively as a fin on a line.
[name="Young Chef"]Jiang was making a fuss about calling a doctor. He was shouting so hard he forgot what time it was.

[name="Blaze"]How long was I out... Wait, where are they?!
[name="Blaze"]Lin Qingyan... Did Ning Yin come by here? I... Seriously, how did I get here?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2026_yu_1#7$1")]
[name="Young Chef"]Alright, slow down. I don't even know where to start with all these questions.

[name="Young Chef"]Last night I was on my way to the night market to get some cheap veggies when I found you lying down in the middle of the street. Thought you were drunk at first.
[name="Young Chef"]I was worried you'd freeze to death or something, so I brought you back here.
[name="Young Chef"]You were cursing up a storm in your sleep, hypocrite this, swindler that, and a lot more besides... Tsk, I don't know where you managed to learn such creative Yanese.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2026_yu_1#2$1")]
[name="Young Chef"]The Ning Yin you mentioned, and whoever this Lin Qingyan is... Never seen them before, so I dunno if they were here.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1")]
[name="Blaze"]I...
[name="Blaze"]I need to go find them—

[name="Blaze"]The Forbidden City.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2026_yu_1#8$1")]
[name="Young Chef"]I just saw a whole bunch of guards patrolling around there. You think you can still get in?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1")]
[name="Blaze"]I don't care. I have to go—

[name="Blaze"]You... What are you talking about?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2026_yu_1#4$1")]
[name="Young Chef"]Just speaking the truth here. You lost yourself, yeah?
[name="Young Chef"]You don't know where your self has gone, where it's wandered off to. You hear a few words from someone else and wouldn't you know it, you barely even know your own name, much less who you are.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2026_yu_1#3$1")]
[name="Young Chef"]Such absurdity...
[name="Young Chef"]A tangerine seed is blown from Jiangnan to Jiangbei, where it takes root and yields fine fruit. What let this seed grow so well wasn't Jiangnan <i>or</i> Jiangbei, but decades worth of rain and sun.
[name="Young Chef"]It's ultimately the same fruit. Jiangnan and Jiangbei might not be the same place, but an orange is an orange. Doesn't matter where you eat it.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2026_yu_1#2$1")]
[name="Young Chef"]All things begin, all things end. There is the outer truth, and the inner truth. Once you figure that out, then you can get back to asking your questions.

[name="Blaze"]You... Do you know something about all this? What do you know?! Tell me!

[multiline(name="Young Chef")]What do I know? I'm a chef, all I know is how to season my ingredients, how to boil stuff, stir-fry stuff, regular fry stuff—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_2026_yu_1#1$1")]
[multiline(name="Young Chef",end=true)]Oh, right. Seeing you reminded me of something.
[name="Young Chef"]Weren't you trying to find authentic tangerine cakes?
[name="Young Chef"]I think I know how to make those.
