[name="Zuo Le"]Not that I mind lending you... but couldn't you just tell the owner instead...? We're total strangers—how would you find me and pay me back?
[charslot]
[name="Penniless Diner"]No, no, no, you see, this jade's not your average thing, it's not fit for just anyone to take. I'm only entrusting it to you because I can tell, you've got a rare air about you.

Zuo Le rummages for some loose coins in his pocket, and hands them to the diner, whose face immediately broadens with delight.

[name="Zuo Le"]When do you plan to pay me back...? Where would we meet?
[charslot]
[name="Penniless Diner"]We'll meet if we do and we won't if we don't. And if we don't, you can just go ahead and pawn this jade off.

Mo Bufu's hands rest on the table, chopsticks in his grasp. For a while, silence, before he finally picks up the spoon and tries a mouthful of soup.
Blaze examines Chef Mo's face closely, but the satisfied look she's hoping for simply does not blossom across the old man's face.
