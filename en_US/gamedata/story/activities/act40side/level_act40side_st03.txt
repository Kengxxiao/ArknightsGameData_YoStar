...What night is it?
A gloomy mausoleum sits in pitch-black silence. In the chaotic darkness, even time seems to come to a standstill.
How long has it been since the last sign of activity in here?
But on this day, a new voice echoes in the tomb.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#2$1")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]I recall meeting Gu Quan in a restaurant several decades ago, when he imparted this to me: 'Too many colors blind the eyes, too many flavors dull the tongue'...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#9$1")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]I only understood his words later, probably owing to my short-sightedness and dull sense of taste.

The young chef leaps off the couch, stretches himself, and rubs his eyes hard.
The kitchen before him remains the same, pots and pans all in place.
He seems to suddenly think of something, and hurriedly opens a cupboard, taking out bottles of oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar.
Carefully, he drips a drop from each bottle into his mouth one by one, his brows tightly knit, deep in thought.
Only after a long time does a smile appear on his face.
