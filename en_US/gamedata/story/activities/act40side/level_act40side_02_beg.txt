The courtyard is silent. Its long, thick walls prevent outside noise from coming in. It's empty, save for an old persimmon tree leaning against the wall in the shade, with its old crown extending over the top of the wall.
No one knows what this old tree has witnessed over the years. We do know that, since its planting, it has turned red, and green, and red again, as the seasons have flown by.
Each year, bright red, fresh persimmons grow from its branches, and each year, these beautiful fruits wipe away old memories of previous harvests.
The old man sits under the tree, sleeping in the shade.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1")]
[name="Ning Shu"]The Judicial Review Office, you say? I haven't talked to anyone there in many, many years. I'm not even sure who's in charge there anymore. Is it Yu Cheng?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#2$1")]

[name="Ning Shu"]I heard that Tianshi Bai was transferred back to Baizao a while ago, yet he still hasn't come to see me, not even for some tea or a bite to eat. I guess he doesn't have time for this old retiree.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1")]

They sit down in an elegant room that's tastefully decorated and furnished. There seems to be an empty space on the wall where a painting should be hanging.
The part of the wall that had once been covered by the painting is a slightly different color, which makes it stick out even more.

[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#2$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]They 'sealed the lips' of the painting with honey. It's an old folk custom to celebrate the New Year. They do this in hopes that the Stove God 'will only say good things and not bad things'. Whoever the thief was, they had some other motive in mind besides theft.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Why did you not report this vandalism?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]I came here to ask you about someone, not something.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Do you remember an individual named Gu Quan?
[dialog]
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[delay(time=1.5)]
[name="Ning Shu"]Grkh...
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Ten years ago, Gu Quan accompanied some Yanese dignitaries on an official visit to Victoria. They encountered a Catastrophe, a blizzard, along the way, and poor Gu drowned in a river.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Have you any memory of that, Mr. Ning?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Yes. How could I forget?
[name="Ning Shu"]I believe it was December. It definitely happened in the winter. By the time the news reached Baizao, it was almost the new year.
[name="Ning Shu"]I remember the Messenger told us that, after the storm came in, the envoys got trapped on the mountain. Gu Quan stayed at the back of the line, helping shepherd everyone else across the river. In the end, he's the one who ended up falling in.
[name="Ning Shu"]Sigh The river must have been freezing cold!
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]It looks like that incident made quite an impact on you.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Gu Quan was a very good worker. He served the Ministry very well. He was very well-read and had excellent calligraphy.
[name="Ning Shu"]It's a pity he had no family. The only remnant of him is a cenotaph in Cemetery of the Virtuous. Every year, the Ministry of Rites sends someone to tend it and pay their respects...
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]No family?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Look at me, blathering on again. Well, anyway, why do you mention Gu Quan?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]A Yanese diplomat dying in a foreign country... that is a major international incident. According to the Laws of Yan, both Yan and the other country must send experts to conduct a joint investigation and compile a final report.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]However, after Gu Quan's death, the Ministry of Rites did no such thing. Even more startling is that the Judicial Review Office's records of the case are remarkably sparse.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]I'm confused. This is clearly a question for the Judicial Review Office. Why are you asking me? I was in the Ministry of Rites.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Well then, let me remind you.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Two months before the team left on their mission, Gu Quan was just an ordinary ninth-rank mandarin. How did he suddenly get promoted to envoy, much less be sent on a mission to Victoria?
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Well, you are the one who signed Gu Quan's transfer order. At the time, you were the Minister of Rites.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Hahaha. Now I understand.
[name="Ning Shu"]You're saying that I deliberately arranged for Gu Quan to go on a diplomatic mission to Victoria, and then 'disposed' of him.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]No. That's not what I'm saying.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]There is something strange going on here. I intend to solve these cases one-by-one, and I humbly ask for your guidance, Mr. Ning.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Since you're so curious about all this, why not ask me a few more pointed questions?
[name="Ning Shu"]Do you think it's odd that I, as a former Minister of Rites, would trouble myself over a mere ninth-rank ceremonial officer? Are you implying, perhaps, that he discovered some unspeakable secret about me?
[name="Ning Shu"]So you're just here to ask me about a ten year old case?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]......
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Hahaha... no matter, no matter. Ask whatever you wish.
[name="Ning Shu"]Just remember, if you keep asking the same questions, you will keep getting the same answers.
[name="Ning Shu"]What kind of answers do you want?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Truthful ones.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Hahaha. I already have one foot in the grave. What reason do I have to deceive you?
[name="Ning Shu"]Then again, if you suspect me of committing so many crimes, then you surely don't view my testimony as credible...
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]I just want you to tell me why Gu Quan was suddenly transferred. Once you tell me that, we'll be able to figure out the rest of it.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Okay, okay. You came all this way to see me, so I think I should tell you what you want to know.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Gu Quan was indeed transferred for a reason: because he specifically requested it.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#13$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]He wanted the transfer?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Yes, he said that he was ill and was afraid he didn't have much time left, so he wanted to return to his hometown in Victoria to live out the rest of his days. So, I agreed to let him join the delegation to Victoria.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#11$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]What illness did he have?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]I'm not clear on the details either. I only vaguely remember that Gu Quan did seem to be in poor spirits around that time.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]But, as such a low-level mandarin, Gu Quan would not have had many opportunities to even meet you. How did he make such a request?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]To be honest, it's a bit embarrassing... but there was a hint of selfishness on my part as well.
[name="Ning Shu"]Gu Quan had magnificent penmanship, so I sometimes had him write letters for me. I also asked him to serve as my children's calligraphy tutor.
[name="Ning Shu"]He had done so much for me, I felt I owed him a favor. Besides, I did not feel his request stemmed from greed.
[name="Ning Shu"]That's all there is to say about Gu Quan's transfer. Do you have any other questions for me?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Since I've heard it directly from you, I'll take what you're saying at face value.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]However, I disagree with one thing you said.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]What?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Anyone who wants to know the truth, be they a mandarin or an ordinary citizen, does not need a special reason for doing so.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Please know, Mr. Ning, that I am indeed only after the truth. I have no other motives.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Now I shall take my leave, sir.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Good day, madam.
