The first time I came to Baizao to further my studies left a deep impression on me. Skyscrapers that blotted out the heavens, an unending sea of brilliant lights.
And in the center of all those lights was the Forbidden City.
A thousand feet it teetered, its lofty heights unseen from the ground.
My teacher said this was where every policy was decided, where every decree was handed down, each one affecting the lives of untold commoners. A duty heavier than mountains.
And thus it is here that every student can put to use all they have learned.
To serve the lands and the people.
But when I stood here, in the flesh, facing that palace of edifice and high wallsâ€”
I felt a chill sap away my breath.

Fire.
None knew where the burst of flame came from, but all it needed was a gust of autumn wind to engulf the entire banquet.
The flickering flames act like wild beasts, brandishing their fangs and claws as they pace about above the table.
The wind blows, and the beasts of fire grow and grow and grow with speed. The conflagration bloats and bulges, letting off unsettling noises. Some liken it to shouting, others to laughterâ€”
Bizarre flames pour like falling rain. Having already tainted the Feast of a Hundred Delicacies, they flit and flicker as they climb up the faces of the panicking mandarins.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]What the... What's going on?
