[name="Blaze"]Mm... not bad!
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]What I mean is, do these tangerine cakes taste like the ones you remember?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#3$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]Umm... well... not exactly.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]They're still not as sweet as the ones I had before. They also don't have quite the same mouth feel.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#6$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]That's strange. This place uses traditional cooking methods. Their snacks are definitely authentic. They haven't changed their recipes in one hundred years.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#11$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]One hundred years? Have tangerine cakes even been around that long?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]No, tangerine cakes are not quite that old, but many famous Baizao snacks do have quite a long history.
[name="Xingzhu"]The tangerine cake you are looking for were actually invented by a scholar who came to Baizao to study in its early years.
[name="Xingzhu"]The scholar's hometown was famous for its tangerines. After he moved to Baizao, he missed those tangerines. It was too far to go home and get them, so he improvised.
[name="Xingzhu"]He smashed up some old, dried tangerine peels and made them into dough, added some sugar, shortening, and spices, and baked them. It was a cheap, easy way to get his tangerine fix.
[name="Xingzhu"]He gave the recipe to his landlord in lieu of paying rent. He even wrote a small poem about them, 'These tangerine cakes are bright and fresh, just like the orange groves back home.'
[name="Xingzhu"]After the scholar passed the imperial examination and assumed office, the tangerine cakes became very famous. People began to view them as a symbol of homesickness.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]Interesting...
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]Symbolic food. First time I've ever heard something like that.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]Yan is a vast land, with many different climate zones, each with their own cash crops and produce. That's why there are many different types of Yanese cuisine. You can trace all of Yan's history through its food.
[name="Xingzhu"]For example, Yan's Four Major Cuisines match up with its Four Great Restaurants, which predate Baizao's transformation into a nomadic city.
[name="Xingzhu"]Cities develop, but flavors remain. It would be odd to find any snack without its own bit of history behind it.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]One of my colleagues told me that there are many different kinds of Tianshis in Yan. You know so much about food, you must be some kind of Tasty Food Tianshi, right?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#11$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]If there really was such an individual, someone who could use Arts to transform stones into vegetables, that might be worth studying, eh?
[name="Xingzhu"]Alas, I am just an amateur foodie. I like to take notes on the food I eat, and its history. Over the years, I've compiled several notebooks full of such information.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]To put it another way, Blaze, if there really were a better recipe for tangerine cakes out there, surely someone here would know about it.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]But I'm telling you! The ones I had when I was younger, they were sweeter, and just better!
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#6$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]That really is rather odd...
[name="Xingzhu"]Traditional tangerine cakes emphasize the fresh essence of the tangerines, not the taste of their pulp. Very little sugar is used, because tangerine cakes are supposed to be a light snack.
[name="Xingzhu"]You're telling me you've eaten much sweeter tangerine cakes, and I'm telling you that I've never heard of such a thing.
[name="Xingzhu"]Maybe we can ask one of the chefs around here to try cooking up a batch with extra sugar, so you can compare?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]But even if we do that, it doesn't prove that the sweeter variety of tangerine cakes ever actually existed before.
[name="Blaze"]What I want to know is, how did the taste of thesetangerine cakes change during their journey from Baizao to Victoria. I'm sure there's a story there somewhere.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]It seems you're just as much of a foodie as I am.

[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#11$1",focus="r")]

[name="Xingzhu"]My word, look at the time! We should have lunch first.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#11$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]Hmm? Lunch?
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]Yes. It's lunchtime. Shouldn't we have some lunch?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#8$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]But I just finished eating snacks from five different restaurants!
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#7$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]Snacks are snacks, but lunch is lunch. You must have a proper lunch, you know!
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#13$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]I don't think my tummy has any more room for lunch...

[name="Blaze"]You know what they say, 'the more the merrier.' Now that I'm here, you can order as much food as you want.
[name="Blaze"]Speaking of food, what is in these wontons, anyway? They're fantastic!
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]Just meat and celery. The key ingredient is the soup!
[name="Xingzhu"]Most places use shellbeast caviar in wonton soup to enhance the flavor. Unfortunately, the finniness of the caviar crowds out the other flavors.
[name="Xingzhu"]This place uses soybean sprouts instead. This makes for a milder soup, which allows the flavor of the wontons to shine!
[name="Xingzhu"]The meat filling for the wontons is fresh beast belly. After the wontons are cooked, the bits of fat will naturally seep into the soup.
[name="Xingzhu"]These wontons are light, yet delicious. They are made of high-quality ingredients which are hard to find elsewhere.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#1$1",focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#3$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]The shopkeeper has been making wontons her whole life. She used to own this shop together with her husband.

[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#3$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]N-Nothing. It's just that most of the places mentioned in this letter no longer exist.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#8$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]Huh? But it was only written a decade ago.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]For Baizao, a decade is enough for the whole city to change.
[name="Xingzhu"]Have you noticed that anything has changed since arriving in Baizao?
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]Well, aside from the food, there are all these energy poles all over the place. It seems like kind of a waste.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#3$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]It may seem wasteful, but in fact, we have no other choice.
[name="Xingzhu"]The city of Baizao was founded a long, long time ago.
[name="Xingzhu"]At that time, Yan had just experienced a great war, and the country was in dire straits. However, suddenly, an extremely rich Originium vein was discovered right next to the ruins of a battlefield.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]Wow. What impeccable timing! You Yanese sure are lucky!
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]No. It wasn't lucky at all. The Originium vein was rich... too rich. It attracted too many Originium particles in one place, which eventually led to Catastrophe.
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]Basically, not only was it difficult to mine, but it also created a vast stretch of land that was prone to Catastrophes, and there was nothing the Yanese could do about it.
[name="Xingzhu"]That is, until one of the Tianshis had an idea—they could build a city right on top of the Originium vein. The city infrastructure would deplete the excess Originium energy, preventing further Catastrophes.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#11$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]Building a city on top of an Originium mine? That sounds like a recipe for disaster!
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]It was indeed an extremely dangerous undertaking. However, the True Lung decided to go ahead with it... and that's how Baizao was founded.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]How did they do it? I can't even imagine...
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]Honestly, I'm not totally sure either. In all the Yanese history books, there is only a single passage that talks about that period—
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#3$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]'Skilled individuals were sent to the disaster zone, and after fifty-three years of effort, a city was built and established as the capital. The city was named Baizao, with the hope of tending all cooking stoves under heaven.'
[charslot(slot = "right", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Xingzhu"]As for the more advanced technical details, you'd probably have to look at some of the materials from the Tianshi Bureaus. That's beyond my area of expertise.
[name="Xingzhu"]So to this day, the Baizao government still encourages us to use this energy.
[name="Xingzhu"]Baizao is constantly changing. That's how these skyscrapers appeared, as well as the numerous nomadic city plates.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#3$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]......
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Blaze"]And what happened to the people who built the city?
