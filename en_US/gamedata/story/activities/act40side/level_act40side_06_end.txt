[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Ning Yin"]But I've spent the last few days on a farewell tour of sorts around Baizao's streets, so I can finish up the Baizao Cuisine & Food Culture somehow.

[name="Ning Yin"]I can clearly recall what year we planted that persimmon tree in the courtyard, and when its fruits make for the best wine.
[name="Ning Yin"]And every restaurant of every road and alley, and what their chefs are like, and how many different ways you can cook each dish.
[name="Ning Yin"]All of a sudden, it hit me that... this very city, moreso than the Ning manor, feels like my home.

[name="Ning Yin"]Grandfather, you're my one and only family. You've always been since I was little.

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#5$1", focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Ning Yin"]When I first joined the Imperial Historical Cabinet to compile annals, there was one thing I could never puzzle out.
[name="Ning Yin"]At some specific point in Yan's millennia of history, out of nowhere, the written word proliferated and education became for all. Even the earliest of the tablets we were studying only went back to that period.
[name="Ning Yin"]So I thought, in that period, someone must have pushed for those changes. But I flipped through practically all the material we had, and I couldn't find a single clue.
[name="Ning Yin"]I had this strange feeling that, there in Yan's history, one person seemed to be missing.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Ning Yin"]Then one day, I met someone strange at a Go club, who told me the story of 'that person'.
[name="Ning Yin"]I thought he was just a yarn-spinning storyteller at first, but as I further researched, I gradually found all his stories to be corroborated.
[name="Ning Yin"]According to him, 'she' was a gentle person who gave her heart and soul, her blood and sweat to the wellbeing of the people. And she gave too much... But how could someone as good as her fail to leave her name in our annals?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4172_xingzh_1#2$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1239_1#1$1")]
[name="Grand Commandant"]I know you and the Ministry of Revenue are both very busy. The Ministry of War simply went to some small pains working out the manpower, the funding, the ration, and even the Ministry of Engineering's postwar repair expenses.
[name="Grand Commandant"]And now you can read together with His Majesty, since we're having an audience and all.

[name="Grand Tutor"]Logistics are calculable, but how many of Yan's people will bleed in this war? Is that a bill you can work out so easily?

[name="Grand Commandant"]So the Grand Tutor means to say, if you can't work it out, then no need to try?

The man behind the curtain lifts his gaze—
In this desolate palace, three banquet seats lay set out in a row to his side, and one of them is truly showing its age.
Faintly, a sigh.

The only presence is a pot of soup boiling on the stove.
