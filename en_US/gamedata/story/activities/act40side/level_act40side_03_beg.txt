[name="Blaze"]I've been hearing about this place since I first set foot in Baizao. What's so special about it?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4172_xingzh_1#1$1")]
[name="Xingzhu"]Remember I told you about the Four Great Restaurants of Baizao, corresponding to the four main branches of Yanese Cuisine, that is, North, South, East, and West?
[name="Xingzhu"]About four hundred years ago, several chefs arrived in Baizao. They each set up their own restaurants and culinary sects. This marked the founding of the four main branches of Yanese cuisine.
[name="Xingzhu"]It was the first head chef of Ding Feng Lou who promoted the founding in the first place.
[name="Xingzhu"]The legendary chef's name has been lost to history. He was the founder of Northern Cuisine, but was also proficient in the other three styles.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4172_xingzh_1#11$1")]
[name="Xingzhu"]With such a storied history, Ding Feng Lou outshined the other three restaurants and became known as the 'number one restaurant in Baizao.'

[name="Xingzhu"]Oh. My apologies!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2026_yu_1#15$1")]
[name="Young Chef"]Hmph, of course, what she said is pretty much accurate. The only thing I'll add is that eventually, the Four Great Restaurants of Baizao started fighting with each other for fame and glory. These squabbles continue to this day, and they're really quite annoying.
[name="Young Chef"]I thought Baizao was a place where all these great chefs could learn from each other. If I had known there was going to be all this infighting, I would not have gone...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#1$1")]

[multiline(name="Young Chef")] In any case, what you need to know is that, as the most famous restaurant in Baizao, Ding Feng Lou, and its Chef Selection Competition, has extremely high standards.
[name="Young Chef"]Ding Feng Lou has not taken on any new disciples in many years. The only reason they're hosting this competition now is because they suddenly got short-handed right when they needed to start preparing for the Feast of a Hundred Delicacies.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4172_xingzh_1#6$1")]
[name="Xingzhu"]But I've also heard that Chef Mo is advancing in age and still hasn't found an apprentice to take over the business...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2026_yu_1#2$1")]
[name="Young Chef"]The format of the competition is different each time, but there is one requirement that stays constant: each chef has to showcase their best dish.

[name="Blaze"]Wait a second...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2026_yu_1#2$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2026_yu_1#18$1")]

[name="Blaze"]When I was little, every year, on my birthday, my mom would make me a bowl of longevity noodles. The taste was nothing special. It was just regular old home cooking.
[name="Blaze"]After I left home and could no longer eat my mom's home cooking, I even forgot what it was like to celebrate a birthday.
