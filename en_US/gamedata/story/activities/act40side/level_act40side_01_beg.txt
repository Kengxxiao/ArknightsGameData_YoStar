[name="Blaze"]So what is this 'Feast of a Hundred Delicacies' you keep talking about?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1632_1#1$1")]
[name="Stern Judicial Official"]You may speak fluent Yanese, madam, but there are clearly gaps in your knowledge of our culture.
[name="Stern Judicial Official"]The Feast of a Hundred Delicacies happens every year in Mid-Autumn, when the True Lung convenes meetings with mandarins at all levels to discuss state affairs.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#1$1")]
[name="Blaze"]If it's just a bunch of government meetings. Why is it called the Feast of a Hundred Delicacies?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1632_1#1$1")]
[name="Stern Judicial Official"]Now, that has a beautiful origin story.
[name="Stern Judicial Official"]Many years ago, the True Lung at the time held a birthday banquet, and all the mandarins presented him with gifts, including all manner of rare treasures from all across Yan.
[name="Stern Judicial Official"]But there was one mandarin, a young Assistant Minister from the Ministry of Revenue, who gave the True Lung a bowl of 'Pearl Jade Soup'.
[name="Stern Judicial Official"]The True Lung lifted the lid off the bowl, only to find a clump of rotten cabbage leaves and a scant few grains of brown rice floating in some water.
[name="Stern Judicial Official"]The True Lung was enraged, demanding, 'What is the meaning of this?!' The Assistant Minister replied, 'There was a flood in Jiangqi this year, so we had a terrible harvest. What you see in the bowl here is what the peasants have been eating every day.'
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#5$1")]
[name="Blaze"]Speaking up for what's right—that's what any good mandarin should do.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#1$1")]
[name="Blaze"]Still, doing it to the True Lung's face, on his birthday like that, takes some serious guts.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1632_1#1$1")]
[name="Stern Judicial Official"]Yes. The surprising thing is, the True Lung did not punish the young mandarin—he praised him and ordered that all other mandarins follow his example in advocating for the people.
[name="Stern Judicial Official"]The True Lung ordered cuts to the court budget and used those funds for disaster relief. He built embankments to guard against future floods, and Jiangqi was saved.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1630_1#1$1")]
[name="Exhausted Judicial Official"]Yes, and the following year, the mandarins presented the True Lung with a bowl of sumptuous 'Fortune Soup' to show him that the finneries were thriving.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1632_1#1$1")]
[name="Stern Judicial Official"]*ahem*...
[name="Stern Judicial Official"]In summation, the annual banquet became a tradition, called the Feast of a Hundred Delicacies, held every year during the Mid-Autumn Festival.
[name="Stern Judicial Official"]And all restaurants in the city serve dishes from the traditional Hundred Delicacies menu, welcoming all the people to join in the celebration.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#4$1")]
[name="Blaze"]Oh. The Yanese really know food, don't they?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#1$1")]
[name="Blaze"]This little shop here is a great example. It may look ordinary, but it serves top notch eats! Just look how many different types of tofu they can make! Amazing!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1")]
[name="Blaze"]Then again, these cakes here... they taste different to the ones I've had before, and not in a good way. I think something's not quite right with them.
