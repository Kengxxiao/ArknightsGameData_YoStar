[name="Chen Che"]The scrollery was heavily guarded, yet on the night of the fire, the guards didn't notice anything.
[name="Chen Che"]Not only was the perpetrator highly skilled in kung fu, but they also had intimate knowledge of the Judicial Review Office's layout. They must have been working with Yu Cheng for quite some time.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]You're saying... you think this was an inside job?
[name="Chen Che"]We cannot be certain.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]How bad was the damage?
[name="Chen Che"]All records that were burned were from old cases, which has little effect on our current work. However, if these cases were ever to be reviewed in the future, there would be no evidence to go on.
[name="Chen Che"]Nearly all of these cases were Yu Cheng's responsibility.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Do you really believe Yu Cheng was the one who burned the scrollery?
[name="Chen Che"]Absolutely not...
[name="Chen Che"]No matter what nonsense he spouts, he was imprisoned when the fire broke out. There's no way he could have done it himself.
[name="Chen Che"]However, I'm sure he's involved in some way. He's working with someone else.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]What did he mean when he suggested the files are 'dirty'?
[name="Chen Che"]Is there something on your mind?
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Do you still remember... the last case Yu Cheng investigated before he retired?
[name="Chen Che"]How could I forget?
[name="Chen Che"]Forty years ago, the Minister of Justice was stabbed in the street. The assassin turned out to be a mad beggar.
[name="Chen Che"]The Judicial Review Office did everything in their power to uncover the man's identity, to no avail.
[name="Chen Che"]In the end, they classified the murder as a random, spur-of-the moment act of violence.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]But nearly thirty years later, Yu Cheng accused the sitting Minister of Rites, Ning Shu, of being the murderer.
[name="Chen Che"]I worked with Yu Cheng for many, many years. I knew him better than anyone.
[name="Chen Che"]However, in his last few years at the Office, he began to change.
[name="Chen Che"]Something radicalized him. He began doing 'whatever it takes' to catch criminals. He even started fabricating evidence to close cold cases and settle old scores.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]If the accusations against him were baseless, then why did Minister Ning resign?
[name="Chen Che"]What do you mean?

[name="Blaze"]I had a good life back at Rhodes Island. Then you showed up and told me my father's death was suspicious, without giving any details.
[name="Blaze"]I came all the way here to Baizao, the place where my dad used to live, and you still haven't told me anything! You've made me stay in this room, day after day, and now you have the gall to yell at me?

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1612_1#11$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1612_1#1$1")]

[name="Lin Qingyan"]If you would aid me, then simply do what you can to avoid danger, understood?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1612_1#11$1")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]As for your father, I just happened to be handed that case a few years ago.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]The case was originally being handled by my predecessor, someone I trusted deeply. Your father seemed to have been spending a lot of time pursuing a certain 'truth' in the last few years of his life.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]His death was suspicious. Every clue we've found hints that there were larger forces at work there. How large? We don't know for certain, nor can we even hope to guess.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]But your mere existence is the most important piece of evidence we have.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Blaze, I vow to you I will find the truth, and once I do, I will tell you everything.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#12$1")]
[name="Blaze"]But these are in fact one of the few things I've found in Baizao that relates to my father.
[name="Blaze"]When I lived with my mother in Victoria, my dad would send them to me from time to time.
[name="Blaze"]I figured that by the time I got my disease under control and figured out what I really believed in, my dad would be back in Victoria, waiting for me to come home. Naive.
[name="Blaze"]Everyone longs for that sort of 'happy ending'.
[name="Blaze"]And yet, by the time I found a place that could treat my Oripathy and finished some of the things I had to do with the bunny's crew... my dad... was gone.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#2$1")]
[name="Blaze"]Before you came and found me, I always thought my dad's death was an accident. I was sad, but there was nothing I could do about it.
[name="Blaze"]But if you're telling me my father was murdered.... then that's an entirely different story.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#9$1")]
[name="Blaze"]I need to learn the truth. I owe that to my father... and myself.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1612_1#1$1")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]......
[name="Lin Qingyan"]In all truth, I know very little about what happened to your father. Many of the old archives have been lost, and very little information can be extracted from what remains.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Just from looking at the case files he left behind, we can see that your father worked as a ceremonial officer in the Ministry of Rites for over ten years but never got promoted. It seems he was not well-suited to serve in public office.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1612_1#3$1")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]However, to stay in a position like that for over a decade... he must have been a good person.

She walks over to the window, closes her eyes, and rubs her temples.
The faraway city lights are shimmering in the twilight. The years of wandering are long over.
People today are moving from one stage of life to the next, as the city guides them and runs right behind them.
Many boundaries are blurred, many high walls become thoroughfares, many hurried footsteps pass over the paving stones. Not everyone is qualified to etch their name into the annals of history.
