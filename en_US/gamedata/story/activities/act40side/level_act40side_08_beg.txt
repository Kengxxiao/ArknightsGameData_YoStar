[name="Yu Cheng"]You were one step away from being able to go back home without a heavy heart, one step away from enjoying your twilight years with your family.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#10$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]Just one small step... Hahahahaha.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]I really should hate you, when you put it like that. I would like nothing more than to charge at you and tear at your flesh with my teeth.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]But on second thought, you have given up decades of your life and your position as Deputy Minister at the Judicial Review Office for me, spending the rest of your years within this cell.
[name="Ning Shu"]No matter how you look at it, it should be you who hates me.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#10$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]Hahahaha... You're overthinking it, Mr. Ning.
[name="Yu Cheng"]I said it before, but I was never any good at my job, or at being a decent human being... Not like Gu Quan.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]I'm a glutton, you see, the type that loves sniffing out deep, hidden truths. I tore open shells to get at the flesh, and got addicted to the sweet, sweet taste of marrow. I'll do anything for it, even if it leaves my hands bloodied and my teeth shattered.
[name="Yu Cheng"]During all these years, you were the biggest, plumpest shellbeast on my dining table. How could I ever hate you?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#2$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]Even if I were to hate... It wouldn't be for anything on my side.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1", focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]But Yu Cheng, why were you so sure I would have come to see you today?
[name="Ning Shu"]If I had just walked away from all this, all your plots and plans would have gone to waste, no?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#10$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]Hahahaha... Because I understand you. I understand you far too well, Mr. Ning.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]I simply had to gamble, that during the years you spent bobbing around the hierarchy of mandarins, you would dirty your hands, but still retain your humanity.
[name="Yu Cheng"]You let Gu Quan live on while he was right under your nose, after all, and raised his daughter to boot.
[name="Yu Cheng"]You care about the fate of that child... Those two children, rather. You wanted to see those girls live carefree, innocent lives while you yet live...
[name="Yu Cheng"]You knew that if you did not relent one day, they would never know peace.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]And so you came to see me... You had to.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]You have looked into these matters already... It seems you managed to find out most of what should have been found out.

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]I only finished deciphering the clues and piecing them all together last year. It shames me to admit as a deputy minister, but my pace was a bit too slow.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#2$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]Gu Quan, on the other hand? He managed to figure it all out years ago.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]I never considered that...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]The year he returned to Baizao, you managed to put him under your watch. But you never thought he would copy decades worth of letters from your home.
[name="Yu Cheng"]By peering through all those letters between grand mandarins and nobles, he, a ninth-rank ceremonial officer, found every survivor of that murder case. He unraveled the threads and pieced the truth together.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Gu Quan's diligence knew no bounds. I underestimated him.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#9$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#8$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Hahahaha... What is there left to say? What sins must be admitted, I shall admit.
[name="Ning Shu"]I really did send someone to kill the Minister of Justice who presided over the Grand Preceptor's case.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]But not because he accused me of being the Grand Preceptor's collaborator in treason...
[name="Ning Shu"]Rather, because the Grand Preceptor's treason was a miscarriage of justice all along.

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#1$1", focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Call it a hunch.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Though you might not have used your kung fu at the time, a mask was not enough to prevent me from thinking that person's figure and skills were familiar. Very familiar.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Afterwards, at the Judicial Review Office, you sought me out and managed to cement this particular suspicion in my mind.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#2$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Come to think of it, you must have been in close contact with Yu Cheng as early as when I was preparing to impeach him. I never considered the possibility you were already cooperating with him at the time.
[name="Lin Qingyan"]From the scrollery fire to the hanging scroll in the Ning Manor, and then on to the fire at Ding Feng Lou. This recent string of mysteries was you trying to lead me along a trail of clues, wasn't it?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#9$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]That was rather rushed and sloppy, now that I look back.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#1$1", focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#16$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Why did you two do all this?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#2$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]Ridiculous as it may sound, this all started with an old case. Not a large one, yet not small either.
[name="Jie Zhen"]A case I happened upon by chance after I joined the Department of Discipline and Supervision.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]The Minister of Justice, assassinated by a beggar in the middle of the street. A case I could barely believe, yet one hastily closed without meaningful buildup or a satisfying conclusion.
[name="Jie Zhen"]Though the assassin had been executed, his identity, his motive... There were simply too many vague unknowns in the file.
[name="Jie Zhen"]As I dug deeper, I noticed that every thread led towards an even bigger case, a case that had snipped all those threads short.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#16$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]The Grand Preceptor's treason...
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]You've investigated that case too.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#16$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]The betrayal of the three Grand Ministers, a case large enough to shake the court, and one that implicates countless others. Forget finding the truth, even just mentioning the Grand Preceptor's name at the time was the greatest of taboos.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#2$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]'The Grand Preceptor incited the prince to regicide.' This was all the history books had to say on the matter.
[name="Jie Zhen"]But nobody knows the truth of what happened the night the old True Lung passed away.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]Who was it who mobilized the city guard? Who went into the palace?
[name="Jie Zhen"]Only later did I realize I was not the only one looking into this case.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]Was this how you got to know Yu Cheng?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]Should I rather call it fowlbeasts of a feather, or friendship at first sight?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]You said the two of you weren't able to follow the trail, so how did you determine the Grand Preceptor was wrongly accused?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]It wasn't our research that lead to this conclusion.

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]...The people cry out, their hearts uneasy...
[name="Ning Shu"]Only those who have experienced the struggle know that Yan's current peace and prosperity were hard-won.
[name="Ning Shu"]It was a very, very long time ago.
[name="Ning Shu"]The old True Lung was diligent. At the time, Originium industries were beginning to change the structure of this great land. Even during Yan's turbulent times, he did not allow her to fall behind the other nations of Terra.
[name="Ning Shu"]And so it was that a great hero was infected with Oripathy in his twilight years. Believing his days were numbered, his many policies began to stray into bias and imbalance.
[name="Ning Shu"]At the time, the prince wished to stop the True Lung... and the Grand Preceptor stood by his side.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]This supposed support was her urging the prince to seize the throne?
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]The old True Lung died the night the prince entered the palace to admonish him. As for the prince? His whereabouts since that night are unknown. Such a tumultuous event demanded an explanation.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]...Which required someone to be charged with everything.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Do you think the current True Lung was unaware of all this...?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#2$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]Hmph.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Changes in the court naturally lead to unrest among the masses. 'The Purge of Traitors'. A very fitting slogan.
[name="Ning Shu"]The then-young True Lung acted with an iron fist to sweep away many courtiers with evil intent, stabilizing the situation as quickly as possible. This ensured this spell of court intrigue never made it outside the walls of the Forbidden City.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]For forty years, I assumed I was the only one aside from the True Lung himself to still remember what transpired.
[name="Ning Shu"]Until ten or so years after that case ended, that young man stood in front of me once again.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]I fear you speak of that time too lightly, Mr. Ning.
[name="Yu Cheng"]It was not only traitors who were 'swept away'. There was also the entirety of the Grand Preceptor's family, twenty-eight in all.
[name="Yu Cheng"]They were all sent to prison. Some committed suicide in their cells to prove their innocence. Those who lived were exiled. I tried to find some trace of them, but it was no use. Couldn't find a single one.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]Except for a child... Spirited away during the turmoil, still swaddled in a blanket.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]I never considered the possibility she still lived, yet never truly believed she had died.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]It seems you've met her.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]A few days ago. Her appearance is... not too similar. But their personality? It's like two peas in a pod.
[name="Ning Shu"]Gu Quan never spoke a word about that child's whereabouts during the decade he spent in Baizao, right up until his death...
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#9$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]I'm sure you're now well aware of why he died on the road back to Victoria.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1614_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Ning Shu"]Yu Cheng, you old bastard.
[name="Ning Shu"]You used Gu Quan's own death to ensure there was no possibility of anyone finding that child, which also gave you an opportunity to investigate me.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Yu Cheng"]At the time I assumed Gu Quan had no success in his exhaustive research into the Grand Preceptor case, which prompted him to leave Baizao in despair.
[name="Yu Cheng"]It was only after many years that I realized it was not the so-called truth that he sought. He had long since found the answers to those troubles you mentioned earlier.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1617_1#2$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]Your investigation should have already revealed that Gu Quan and Yu Cheng knew each other.
[name="Jie Zhen"]After taking the child away, Gu Quan kept the secret of her whereabouts to himself for decades. But before he met his untimely end, he confided in the only 'friend' he had, Yu Cheng.
[name="Jie Zhen"]After his death, Yu Cheng immediately began to search for her.
[name="Jie Zhen"]However, he was unable to personally act as deputy minister at the Judicial Review Office. He entrusted the task of performing discreet inquiries to me, far from the center of court politics, so as to not attract attention.
[name="Jie Zhen"]By the time I found her in Victoria, she was already infected.
[name="Jie Zhen"]I could not take her back to Baizao right away. For the sake of protecting her, I had no choice but to place her in the care of a medical organization that treated the Infected.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1612_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lin Qingyan"]So it was you...
[name="Lin Qingyan"]You were already aligned at the time, I see.

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#9$1", focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#1$1", focus="r")]
[name="Jie Zhen"]Yu Cheng would not have told you these himself. The risk was too great. There could not be a third person who knew of this in all of Terra.
[name="Jie Zhen"]But he was always searching for a suitable candidate... One with courage, who stood for truth.
[name="Jie Zhen"]He has long since been ready to give his life for this cause. I am happy to dirty my hands doing what must be done in his stead.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1618_1#2$1", focus="r")]
