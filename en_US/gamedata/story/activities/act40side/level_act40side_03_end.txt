[name="Zuo Le"]There is still another Proxy in Baizao...
[name="Zuo Le"]This Proxy is the 'youngest', and the most unique.
[name="Zuo Le"]According to the Sui Regulator's observations, in the hundreds of years since he left the tomb, he has never used any of his powers. The Sui Regulator does not know how to deal with him...

[name="Zuo Le"]There's only one thing that's a little suspicious—one hundred years ago, after Wang escaped from prison, he came to Baizao and has remained here ever since.
[name="Zuo Le"]Wang used to frequently interact with other Proxies, so I am afraid that during his current return to Baizao, the lone Proxy who stayed here would also be part of his plan.

[name="Taihe"]What do you plan to do?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4121_zuole_1#2$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]I don't know yet, so I'm going to go take a look...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4121_zuole_1#1$1")]
[name="Zuo Le"]...And see for myself.

[name="Blaze"]What do you think? I've memorized every step, from washing the vegetables to serving the noodles. I can do this all by myself now!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_1040_blaze2_1#1$1")]
[name="Blaze"]Of course, it's all thanks to Xingzhu for figuring out a genius solution—I just need to dip my hands in ice water for five minutes before kneading the dough, and it comes out fine.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4172_xingzh_1#11$1")]
[name="Xingzhu"]It looks good, and I can taste the craftsmanship in the dish.

[name="Young Chef"]It'll do, even if it's far from perfect.
[name="Young Chef"]If anyone could cook as well as me after just a few classes, then all my years of study would be in vain.

[name="Blaze"]Hey, I've been working hard for so long, and tomorrow is the big day. Can't you at least say something encouraging?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2026_yu_1#15$1")]
[name="Young Chef"]I just don't want you to get a big head... Alright, maybe you're right—a little pep talk might do you good; otherwise, you'd be too scared to cook the minute you meet Mo Bufu.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_2026_yu_1#21$1")]
[name="Young Chef"]Remember: there's nothing to be afraid of. Mo Bufu is old. Show him the power of your youth!

[name="Blaze"]Everything's ready. Let's go win one at Ding Feng Lou tomorrow!
