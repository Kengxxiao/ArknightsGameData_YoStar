Same supplies of different qualities (normal or advanced) cannot be activated at the same time. You can only choose one of them.
[Tutorial(target="pool_first_defense_stage_in_group", searchBtnInChildren=true,            animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Tap to view details about normal stages.

We can garrison Operators on the Special Front to activate these supplies and gain buffs for our Kernel Breakthrough operations.
[Tutorial(target="pool_defense_stage_enemy_area", searchBtnInChildren=true,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Here are the enemies that will appear on the Special Front. We can review intel in advance and prepare for battle.
[Tutorial(target="pool_defense_stage_btn_start", searchBtnInChildren=true,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] To prevent further enemy attacks, we need to garrison Operators to defend specific locations in Special Front. Operators garrisoned for defense cannot participate in Kernel Breakthrough operations or be selected for support.
[Tutorial(target="pool_defense_stage_btn_start", searchBtnInChildren=true,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Operators garrisoned in Special Front can be withdrawn and reassigned to other operations.
[Tutorial(target="pool_defense_stage_btn_start", searchBtnInChildren=true,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] However, combat supplies will be deactivated without garrisoning Operators. Therefore, swapping out Operators is a better option than simply withdrawing them.
[Tutorial(target="pool_second_defense_stage_in_group", searchBtnInChildren=true,            animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Tap to view details about advanced stages.

[Tutorial(target="pool_defense_stage_btn_start", searchBtnInChildren=true,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Advanced stages have their own unlock requirements that you may want to review. Operators garrisoned in normal stages cannot be used in advanced stages.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] You can review all supplies here as well as stage details and garrison information.
