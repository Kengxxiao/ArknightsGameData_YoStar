The memory is blurry, but Luchino remembers the voice.
The night that Umberto brought him back to Tailor de Montano...
Sitting on a chair, Luchino looked blankly at the unfamiliar room before him, filled with various fabrics and tools.
Umberto was outside talking to someone. Suddenly, he turns around, and through the window Luchino thought Umberto was showing him to someone else, but does not see who it is.
His grandfather, his only living relation. Luchino feels his stomach churn with nervousness.
Then, he hears a voice mixed with anger and resignation exclaim, 'Shameless human! Up to the same old tricks again!'

[name="Vargo"]I observed Umberto for a long time.
[name="Vargo"]I watched him serve customers of every kind, casually putting his scissors through some of their throats while taking measurement, without getting a single drop of blood on himself.
[name="Vargo"]He was not a warrior, like Ingrid, but he was smart and knew how to make the most of who he was.
[name="Vargo"]He was also good at disguising himself. He spent most of his time in Tailor de Montano, and he was equally in demand as a tailor as he was as an assassin.
[name="Vargo"]That's why I chose him. I told him about the Signori dei Lupi, and the existence of the game.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4155_talr_1#5$2")]
[name="Luchino"]Nonno's stories were true!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4155_talr_1#1$2")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1548_1#1$1")]

[name="Luchino"]What did nonno want to do?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1548_1#1$1")]
[name="Vargo"]Umberto wanted to raise his pup to adulthood, before delivering my victory.
[name="Vargo"]His wife had passed away, he said, and his young pup, Luca, was too young to survive without him.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4155_talr_1#5$2")]
[name="Luchino"]That was it?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1548_1#1$1")]
[name="Vargo"]That was it. I agreed.
[name="Vargo"]The society of humans was no more dangerous than the wilderness. I did not imagine it would take up so much of his time and energy.
[name="Vargo"]I visited the tailor's shop from time to time to make sure he was not deceiving me.
[name="Vargo"]That day, Umberto shut down his assassination business, devoting all his time to the sewing machine, fabric, and the young pup as it grew.
[name="Vargo"]But his hands were still steady, and his eyes still sharp. Therefore, I kept my promise.
[name="Vargo"]I needed a Fang that would not break, not easily-distracted prey. I gave him time. I had plenty of it.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4155_talr_1#6$2")]
[name="Luchino"]But papa...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1548_1#1$1")]
[name="Vargo"]Died meaninglessly.
[name="Vargo"]I gave Umberto plenty of time to recover from the shock.
[name="Vargo"]It may not have been how Umberto planned it, but at least now he was no longer burdened. And so one night I visited him again, and demanded that he hold up his end of the bargain.
[name="Vargo"]But my Fang once again bargained with me—
The Signore dei Lupi pauses and glares at the young tailor before him.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4155_talr_1#5$2")]
[name="Luchino"]Do you mean...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1548_1#1$1")]
[name="Vargo"]He learned that his pup had a pup of its own, the last family he had... He wanted to raise you to adulthood too, before the hunt begins.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1548_1#1$1")]
[name="Vargo"]This time, I did not assent. But he seems to have forgotten who he was, and who I was to him!

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4155_talr_1#6$2")]

Red gazes unblinkingly at the old man's face.
She had seen the deaths of many, all of whom had died with an expression like a mask on their faces.
Even the limp true wolf that was waiting for death had terror on her face when Red came in, which only changed to relief in her final moments.
As for the Reunion members in the Lungmen ruins, and those who invaded Rhodes Island, their faces were twisted from rage or fear.
But the expression on the face of the old man before her never changed, from the moment she walked into the Tailor de Montano, to this very instant. Red was finally certain that he was not disguising himself.

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#7$1", focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_1038_whitw2_1#11$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lappland"]Not many people would interrupt me like this, you know—yes, he's my lackey now.
[name="Lappland"]A few Siracusans came to Nuova Volsinii together, but started brawling out in the wilderness for no reason, and the car ended up in front of me.
[name="Lappland"]Siracusa invited, so I had to answer, just like you had to return to Volsinii last year.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#7$1", focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_1038_whitw2_1#11$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lappland"]One year ago, I was sitting at that table in the Grey Hall with you when you won this new nomadic city from that Befana Sicilia.
[name="Lappland"]You could call me one of the startup investors in this youthful dream of a new Siracusa.
[name="Lappland"]Of course I needed to be here at the one-year anniversary of Nuova Volsinii, to celebrate with my friends!
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#7$1", focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_1038_whitw2_1#11$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lappland"]I prefer Vulpos who aren't so much like wolves.
[name="Lappland"]A Vulpo mother from a distant land, who returned to Siracusa to seek justice for her Oripathy-afflicted daughter... Touching story, isn't it?

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_1038_whitw2_1#12$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lappland"]Helped her find the culprit. Super easy, barely any inconvenience.

[name="Mafioso A"]Complete Antonio's mission, capture the courthouse, then get in touch with the port.
[name="Mafioso A"]Do the reinforcements have their weapons?

[name="Mafioso A"]Maybe some of us haven't touched a weapon in a year, but we ain't any more out of practice than these cargo-hauling scemo.

[name="Lavinia"]But I will not sign this verdict, and this decision is final.
[name="Lavinia"]Nuova Volsinii will not tolerate the crimes of the mafia, but that doesn't mean other people can use the opportunity to achieve their own goals.
[name="Lavinia"]I've gotten letters from many friends over the past year. Some of them are judges or lawyers in other cities; others have chosen to pursue a different career.
[name="Lavinia"]They shared a lot of advice with me, about the jurisprudential basis of the New Urban Management Act, and specific room for improvement.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#8$1")]
[name="Lavinia"]I read many feelings between the lines. Concern, confusion, hope, even envy...
[name="Lavinia"]The New Urban Management Act is a unique thing in Siracusa. It is the basis of this city's existence. Many have their eyes upon it; even more have sacrificed for it.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4065_judge_1#7$1")]
[name="Lavinia"]It's true that it can be powerless at times. But it's especially in times like this that I cannot allow it to become empty words, much less a tool to be exploited.

[name="Lyudmila"]These people have gotten their hands on weapons. They have become true wolves. The situation is out of control.
[name="Lyudmila"]I saw what the mafiosi are capable of when I first came to Siracusa as a kid. They slaughtered my uncle's entire family in just half an hour.
[name="Lyudmila"]In a few moments I will release smoke to obstruct their view. Get the guys out of here when that happens. Hand signs, signals, whatever, I know you have a way.
[name="Lyudmila"]You'll need to be quick. I've never released smoke in such a large area before, so I don't know how well it will work, or how long I can keep it up.
[name="Lyudmila"]The trucks are right behind us. Get in, get away.
[name="Lyudmila"]I wasn't with Sommer that night. It's partly my fault that he's dead...
[name="Lyudmila"]There's no much that a luckless loner like me can do, but I can't let my brothers and sisters die here.

The beast masked-figures on one side, the truck drivers on the other, like they are standing on two sides of a river.
There is no weapon on the ground, only shattered boxes. The weapons are in their hands.
Everyone hears the sounds filling the air.
The rumbling of floats, impromptu band performance, the spirited yelling of acrobats... the parade draws ever closer.
Then, sounds that are fainter, but even more audible. The sound of guns being loaded and locked, Arts units being activated, crossbow safeties pins being unlocked...
There is nowhere to hide. There is nowhere to run.
No one has moved, yet. At the first shot, the dammed river will burst, and the tide of madness will wash over everything.
...
No one speaks. Nerves are wound to the very tightest. Everyone is listening to the sounds, and their own racing heartbeats.
A new day will dawn upon Nuova Volsinii soon.
But the night is long.
