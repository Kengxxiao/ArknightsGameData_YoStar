[name="Radio"]Buongiorno, dear residents.
[name="Radio"]After several months of preparation, Carnevale will be held as scheduled on the evening of November 9th, where hundreds of thousands of citizens will be on the streets celebrating the one-year anniversary of Nuova Volsinii.
[name="Radio"]According to the Carnevale organizing committee, all the beast floats have been assembled at the port, and will be moved to the expansion plate today in preparation for the night parade.
[name="Radio"]The street theater competition has also concluded. The most popular team will gain the privilege of illuminating the floats on the behalf of every citizen here on Carnevale night...
[name="Radio"]Other shortlisted plays will also be performed on both sides of the parade path alongside the floats.
[name="Radio"]The committee hopes that everyone will cooperate and maintain the floats' mystery before their forms are unveiled on Carnevale night! Please rein in your curiosity, and do not sneak a look, photograph or spread any float-related information!

[name="Sommer"]Can you guarantee—
[charslot]
There is no one available to answer him. The mafiosi already left, leaving him on his own.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1544_1#1$1")]
[name="Antonio"]Signor Saluzzo claims he submitted testimony out of his responsibility as a citizen, but this incident actually involves Venezia Trucking.
[name="Antonio"]The demand for our vehicles here has spiked in the last two months because of Carnevale, and we had to order an impromptu shipment of automotive consumables from the other cities.
[name="Antonio"]This newly-arrived batch of goods has already cleared custom, and the Truckers' Union was helping us do a last-mile delivery. It was an impromptu request, which is why they haven't updated this job to their schedule.
[name="Antonio"]Signorina Lavazza, do correct me if I got anything wrong.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1542_1#2$1")]
[name="Eirene"]You're right, we do have the paper trail, if needed.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1544_1#1$1")]
[name="Antonio"]As for why that truck was found at the port amongst the parade floats, we don't know who did it yet, so I implore the police to continue their investigation.
[name="Antonio"]Though at least, the Truckers' Union did not use their truck illegally, and Signorina Lavazza was merely a bit negligent in this whole affair.
[charslot]
[name="Judge"]We'll verify the information.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1564_1#9$1")]
[name="Lappland"]Oh, the poor driver's pretty lucky. We're so close to the end of the tunnel.
[name="Lappland"]The pivotal testimonies from my father and Venezia Junior are enough to clear Eirene of suspicion. Nothing will happen to her.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#2$1")]
[name="Texas"]But the suspect has now become an outsider.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1")]
[name="Texas"]Eirene's the actual person involved, but she can't even get a word in. The courtroom's turned into an exclusive stage for the Venezias and Saluzzos.
[name="Texas"]These two factions are clearly fighting under the table, but they seem to have a tacit understanding once they're in court.
[name="Texas"]Everyone knows that's how the mafia works.
[name="Texas"]They want to claim complete innocence, and seize the Truckers' Union for themselves at the same time.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1564_1#9$1")]
[name="Lappland"]Of course. After all, we haven't found the actual person who started the fire.

[name="Mafioso B"]Volsinii? The old-school musical theaters are all there. I'm planning to go to the more sophisticated establishments.

[name="Mafioso B"]Tsk. You better tuck your tail in if you do, Saluzzo.
[name="Mafioso A"]Hah. Want me to recommend you some ticket vendors in Volsinii?
[name="Mafioso A"]You're a pretty good guy, and get work done quick. If you can't get along with the Venezias, come find me and I'll introduce you to some guys.

Lyudmila sees the two yapping openly, but she could not care any less what they are talking about.
Her sole target is the golden lighter one of them is playing with in his hand.
She recognizes that lighter, and knows the two are not its owners. It belongs to a driver who doesn't smoke.
[charslot(duration=1)]
......
What Lyudmila doesn't know is that it originally belonged to a famiglia associate.
After a roller-coaster ride, it ends up back in the hands of the mob once more.
