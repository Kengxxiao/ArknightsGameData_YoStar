[name="Lappland"]We managed to get it fixed when it was just a bunch of scrap metal lying out there in the wilderness. It's strong, trust it.
[name="Lappland"]Or do you not trust my driving skills? I don't fool around with my own life... except when necessary.
[name="Zaaro"]You don't want the police to find you and throw you in jail, or the mafia to find you and throw you into a meat grinder, do you? At least, not yet.
[name="Lappland"]We're getting better at reading each other's minds, Zaaro.
[name="Lappland"]We still have a Carnevale to go to, after all.
[name="Zaaro"]I thought you would scorn the Carnevale for lacking in revelry, seeing all the colorful lights and balloons that line the streets.
[name="Lappland"]Of course not.
[name="Lappland"]Carnevale had been a thing for centuries, dating back to when Siracusa was just a backwater province of Leithanien.
[name="Lappland"]The Lupo of Siracusa found that they were still restless and uneasy, even after getting their own city, and the order of the famiglia.
[name="Lappland"]And so, for a few days in a year, the famiglie run amok in the city, settling scores, fighting over territory, or simply engaging in wanton violence.
[name="Lappland"]Assault, arson, robbery, murder—everything was fair game as long as you had your mask on.
[name="Lappland"]The first thing Signora Sicilia did when she came to power was to abolish the festival, but Nuova Volsinii has persuaded her to permit its revival.
[name="Lappland"]They hope that reviving the festival without the brutality and cruelty would give this blank slate of a city new meaning, and a sense of belonging for the people who have come to seek out a new life.
[name="Lappland"]Is that not Carnevale—a wonderful thing?
[name="Zaaro"]Have we gotten into poetry now? Your showmanship is beyond mortal help, Lappland.
[name="Lappland"]Just excited about it.
[name="Lappland"]I promise that the reborn festival will be an unforgettable one for everyone—the Lupi included.
[name="Zaaro"]I hope you remember our agreement. This round is coming to a close. Do not disappoint me, Lappland.
[name="Zaaro"]As I said, our battle will continue for thousands upon thousands of years.
