A noise rouses Isidro from his musings and causes him to halt his steps.
He turns around and sees the dark night lit up on the horizon.

Isidro steps forward without hesitation.
It is a decision made not with reason, but pure impulse.
He runs as if his life depends on it, retracing his old set of footprints, towards the direction that he came from.
That same set of footprints is no longer lonely.
