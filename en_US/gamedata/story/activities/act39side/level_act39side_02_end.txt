The sound of metal scraping against stone echoes out from the cave, followed by a slender Seaborn slowly slithering its way out, its form warped and twisted.
Each of its tentacles is wrapped around a weapon. As their points and edges drag across the stone walls, they keen and wail.
It slowly approaches the saltfin meat, and slowly eats away at it, its eyes fixed on Juana the entire time.
