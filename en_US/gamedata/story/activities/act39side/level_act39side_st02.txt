Not a word comes out of Silver. He grabs at the air as he collapses, but only manages to pull out the drawer.
Flower petals pour out, covering him in them.
Dried flowers, rotted flowers, flowers that had turned to dust. Flowers from a few years ago, from a decade ago, from decades ago.
The flowers that the townsfolk had offered to their calificador in gratitude over the years, all pour down upon him.
[name="Anastasio"]...Flowers?
