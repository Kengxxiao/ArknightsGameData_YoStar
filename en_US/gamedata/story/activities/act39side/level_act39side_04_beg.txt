[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1581_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Juana"]Perhaps as an attempt to escape, or perhaps a meaningless act of imitation...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1577_1#10$1",focus="l")]
[name="Isidro"]...What exactly is going on here?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1581_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Juana"]It is difficult to explain. After trapping it here, I issued a bounty, inviting any swordsman to try their hand at killing it.
[name="Juana"]Many have attempted it, but all have become a part of it, along with their blades.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1577_1#10$1",focus="l")]
[name="Isidro"]Now I'm even more confused. Why did you trap it here? Why were you looking for someone to kill it?
[name="Isidro"]And why do you want me to learn swordplay from it?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1581_1#7$1",focus="r")]
[name="Juana"]I was never the original captain of the fleet. It was it... him.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1577_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Isidro"]Him?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1581_1#7$1",focus="r")]
[name="Juana"]His name was Cruz.
[name="Juana"]When the waters that inundated this land subsided, the remaining Seaborn began to attack the cities in a frenzy.
[name="Juana"]We fought hard and slew most of them, but this one was particularly hard to kill. Cruz lured it into a cave, using himself as bait, and both became trapped here.
[name="Juana"]The last time I saw him, he named me captain and asked me to bring the others back to the sea.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1577_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Isidro"]Why not tell them the truth? I've heard the crew spreading terrible rumors about you and the Seaborn.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1581_1#2$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1577_1#7$1",focus="l")]
[name="Isidro"]So you came up with this entire plan back then?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1581_1#7$1",focus="r")]
[name="Juana"]No. It was Cruz who gave it to me. He had long expected that he would die before I did, so he told me everything, that I might continue his work after his death.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1577_1#6$1",focus="l")]
[name="Isidro"]You should have freed him from... this...
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1581_1#2$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1581_1#7$1",focus="r")]
[name="Juana"]I couldn't do it, not with my own hands... Even though I know it's just a Seaborn. I love him, just as I love the time we spent sailing far and wide.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1581_1#1$1",focus="r")]

[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1581_1#11$1",focus="r")]
[name="Juana"]That way, at least, I'll get to see his swordplay once more.
