The layers of Arts energy field on the transmutation table collapse in an instant. The metallic substance that had gleamed with a shiny glow a moment ago is now a pile of charred mud.
Isidro pulled the probe back just in time to avoid damaging it, but the compass parts he had assembled now lie in pieces.
Isidro runs his fingers through the black mud, trying to figure out the reason for the failure.
But the mud holds no answers. All the clever ideas, the well-laid plans that he had put into it are nowhere to be found.
