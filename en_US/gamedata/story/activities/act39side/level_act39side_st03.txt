[name="Teach"]Whatever the future holds, we're together now, and we're going out to sea!
[name="Teach"]So stop thinking too much and grab that rope!
[name="Juana"]Got some rum for you, Captain Isidro! Say something!
Isidro stands atop the bow. He can feel the air grow moist. It is an exciting feeling.
[name="Isidro"]Into the distance.

A trail of blood leads from the steam to the depths of the boundless Salt Flat.
A cold tongue tastes the blood in the mouth. Broken limbs keep crawling, driven by a powerful desire that lives on without its master.
A short distance away, an appendage breaks through the salt layer, wiggling towards a sunlight it has not seen for many years. Then, a second, a third...
It is another powerful desire without a master, compelling the light-emitting organ to reach for the sun, as though trying to gain the sun's light.
