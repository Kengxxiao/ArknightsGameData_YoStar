Isidro stands before the transmutation table. The probe in his hand makes a sharp sound as it swipes through the air, an Arts energy field forming along the lines that it draws.
He carefully removes the outer casing of the compass and places it on the table. The viscous substance inside begins to liquify, creating waves in the direction of the energy flow.
Arts energy and Corazonix intertwine into a golden light illuminating the salt flat outside through the gaps in the workshop walls.
The sailors have never seen anything like it. They begin to gather one by one.

[name="Juana"]How long have you been waiting here, Javi?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1579_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Javier"]Since morning.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#10$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]Didn't Teach tell you I had private business I needed to attend to?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1579_1#7$1",focus="r")]
[name="Javier"]In all my time by your side, you've never had 'private business' even once. Do you even have a life outside this fleet?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#10$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]I never said I did.
[name="Juana"]So why were you looking for me?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1579_1#5$1",focus="r")]
[name="Javier"]...Would you give up the compass, if we found another way besides going out to sea?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]I'm listening.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1579_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Javier"]The mates who got back from AarÃ³n said we'll be pardoned if we hand over the compass and the thief. That they'd let us live in town, or go wherever we want.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]And you believe them?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1579_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Javier"]I looked into it. The offer's real, at least.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#6$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]When? And why wasn't I informed?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1579_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Javier"]Didn't want to bother you while you were recuperating.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]...And who asked you to be so protective of me?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1579_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Javier"]How else would I treat the woman who raised me?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]It feels like it was only yesterday. Now you're taller than I am.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1579_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Javier"]When I was little, I used to pray to grow up faster, taller, and stronger, so that I could share your burden.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1579_1#2$1",focus="r")]
[name="Javier"]Guess my wish came true.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#11$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]You'll always be that little boy to me, no matter how big you are.
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1579_1#9$1",focus="r")]
[name="Javier"]But what about my thoughts? Will you still treat them as the ideas of a little boy?
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]......
[name="Juana"]No, Javi, I won't. I know it's a feeble concession, the kind that only an adult can make.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#9$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]But I'd sooner die than surrender to them.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]How many of the friends you grew up with have already died at their hands?
[charslot(slot="r",name="avg_npc_1579_1#1$1",focus="r")]
[name="Javier"]I'll never forget, SeÃ±ora Juana...
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#8$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]My crew and I did everything for them, when times were hardest!
[name="Juana"]Cruz, myself, and our crew fought the Seaborn to protect them!
[name="Juana"]We spared what little rations we had, so they wouldn't have to feed on their own corpses!
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]And how did they repay us? By chasing us into the Salt Flat as soon as the Inquisition arrived!
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#8$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]That never would've happened to Cruz if they hadn't turned a blind eye!
[name="Juana"]I will never bow my head to those ingrates.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#2$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]I love you, Javi, all of you, whether you believe it or not. Just as I loved all the mates who fought alongside me amidst the waves.
[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_npc_1581_1#8$1",focus="l")]
[name="Juana"]They're long gone, but I still see them in you all. The legacy of blood works in such mysterious ways.
[name="Juana"]That's why I can never forgive them... I hope you understand.
