A voice from ashore cuts through the water. He cannot see the person's face clearly, but that gentle, friendly tone sounds reassuring.

There. A solid metal disc, embossed with a complex design, resting atop some wafting weeds.
He strokes its face before grasping it in his hand. He swims away, the stranger's face getting ever clearer as he gets closer to shore.

The dawn light falls upon the coin, and a stray ray reflects onto Isidro's eyelid, causing him to blink. The light wanders, and the circular marking on the coin begins to ripple.
He begins to feel discomfort and hands the coin to the man ashore, though the man is in no hurry to receive it. Instead, he grabs onto Isidro's legs and lifts him up by the feet.
The boy struggles, and the man ashore begins to speak:

The rays of the setting sun seep through the cracks of the salt ship's frame, shining onto Isidro's eyelid. He blinks in discomfort.
People walk by, and none can resist snickering at him as they pass.
He feels a little dizzy. The faint laughter causes his cheeks to flush, though it might just be an effect of being hung upside down.
Out here in the Salt Flat, simple tents and ramshackle shacks are put up one after the other.
Enormous salt ships are berthed on either side of the road, like a herd of slumbering seabeasts.
Upon their masts hang great sacks for gathering rainwater, flapping in the wind as they await clouds to pass overhead.
Upon the road, people walk shoulder to shoulder, laughing and squabbling, until all of a sudden a quarrel breaks out, which soon escalates into a chaotic all-out brawl.
And in the quieter corners, some are pulling their lovers in close for an intimate kiss.
