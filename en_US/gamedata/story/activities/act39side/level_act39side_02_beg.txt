Young Isidro bites down on the root of his tooth with great force, but he cannot stem the flow of stinging pain bubbling up from his gum.
Before him, a former classmate's corpse lies under the foot of his mentor.
The corpse's long-cold limbs are lined with an azure mucus that makes him retch.
Through the tears in his eyes, a gentle voice like flowing water pierces the depths of his heart.
[name="Aulus"]Why do you wipe away your tears, Isidro?
[name="Isidro"]You killed him...
[name="Aulus"]The sea and the land are as one. To mix them together is nothing more than erasing the barriers between them.
[name="Aulus"]He decided, of his own free will, to embrace the salt and water flowing within his own body, to share all of his existence with us.
[name="Aulus"]Be not afraid, be not hateful, derisive, loathing... Shut not the windows, bar not the doors, close not your heart. No longer shall there be polluted blood or shameful pain.
[name="Aulus"]There will come a day when all will give their all to each other.
Suddenly, the corpse on the floor jerks like a fin out of water, letting out a gurgle of what sounds like grief, before falling flat once more.
Isidro watches the corpse's eyelids slowly lift, revealing the eyes of some unfamiliar creature.
Its lips open wide, and a voice, human yet inhuman, warbles out.
'You are... the same... as me...'

A variety of sounds leak into the shed from his surroundings. Some weeping, some arguing, but mostly cursing.
