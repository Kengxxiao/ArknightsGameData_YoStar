Javier musters the last bit of strength he has, trying to stand.
But the floor is wet and sticky with blood. It is all he can do to crawl forward, little by little.

Then the sailors come, one after another, lifting their new leader from the blood, the one who fought with them to the bitter end.
The blood they shed in the deadly struggle mingles on the ground. They put their shoulders together.

The Corazonix on Isidro's right arm pulses. He swings his sword behind him and dodges towards the right.
Anastasio follows closely, his blade pointed at Isidro's throat.

Isidro knew that the boiling steam would gush out from a hole in the ship, stopping Anastasio's pursuit.
Isidro takes his stance again. He sees how Anastasio's sword-holding hand is scalded by the steam, yet it doesn't tremble in the slightest.

Isidro thrusts into the steam. Anastasio's sword falls from his hand with a clang.
But his handcannon is now pressed upon Isidro's brow.

Anastasio is silent. He will not say another word until he has pulled the trigger.
Isidro is forced back to the edge of the ship. There is nothing behind him but empty air.

The sound of the handcannon's shot echoes through the hollow bones of the valley.
Isidro sees Anastasio put the handcannon back on his belt, then close his eyes as though he had just been born again.
Isidro turns his headâ€”the bottomless pit is right below him. The heat gushing within the bones resonates with the Corazonix on his arm. He knows the steam is about to swallow him.
At the end, he looks towards the sky.
Across the towering bones, through the heat wave of the steam, he can see clouds and sky, just like the azure ocean and white waves from the stories.
The ocean he had wanted to see with his own eyes.
Isidro falls towards the steam vent.
