Juana takes the bottle, climbs down the saltfin's back, and sits down, leaning against it.

Juana unhurriedly downs the liquid in the bottle, casually tossing the bottlecap into the air and catching it with her other hand. Isidro can only watch and wait.
There is movement in Juana's throat from time to time. She takes her time swallowing.
Or, rather, it takes great effort for her to swallow.
