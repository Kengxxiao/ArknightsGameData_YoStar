A small paper box sits on her desk, carefully lined with cotton. Inside lies a tiny fowlbeast—already dead but still harboring a faint lingering warmth.

The noble red dragon loosens her grip in shock, and her sister's body drops to the ground, as cold as it was before her heart was pierced.
It is not blood but purple fire that roars from the wound spanning her entire torso. It instantly floods the balcony and flows down the citadel.

Before her own flames can emit even the tiniest spark of light, the purple fire spreads across the city, burning the whole of Na Saoirsí.
The last time she looked out from this very spot, the flames were scattered like stars in the sky. When she had returned earlier that day, they coated the whole city with a cold and gloomy hue.
And now...
Na Saoirsí itself burns fiercely, just like every other restless corpse she has seen.
