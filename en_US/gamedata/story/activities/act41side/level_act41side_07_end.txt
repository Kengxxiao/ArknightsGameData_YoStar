[name="Brigid"]Nemos, Reed...
At the city gates, the nomad looks back at the citadel in the distance one last time.
She resists the urge to turn tail and flee at the acrid burning smell. She knows what it signifies.
She knows she should do as Nemos said, and leave the city to seek the wakemen as quickly as possible, regardless of whether Loughshinny is successful.
But despite the urgency in Nemos's voice, she did not sound like she believed things would take a turn for the better, nor did she believe that Brigid could convince the wakemen to come.
Brigid could smell the same burning smell coming from Nemos. It reminded her of the obsessions that only the dead could have.
