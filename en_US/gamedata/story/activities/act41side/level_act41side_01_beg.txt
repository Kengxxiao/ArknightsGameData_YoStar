Legend has it that the architect deliberately shaped the plate with uneven elevations to mirror the old Taran capital.
Legend has it that Tara's stonemasons showcased their finest craftsmanship in every building they made—save for one. They refused to add even a single ornament to the citadel, knowing it would be inhabited by a puppet king.
Loughshinny has heard many stories like this, but no story can tell you whether it is itself a true flame, or merely its shadow cast on the wall.
And so, she follows her sister up the steps and looks down at the city with her own eyes.
She sees the empty pedestal in the square below. It seems to be waiting for something massive to be placed upon it.
She sees the winding, undulating cobblestone roads stretching from the square, and the humble stone houses, so simple they inspire a sense of affection.
But after she focuses her gaze and takes a harder look, she finally sees the thing she had sensed before, the thing that had separated her from the other residents.
It is something that definitely does not belong in the city.
