[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_234",focus="m")]
[name="'The Ombudsman'"]At the time, he told us he took out a whole squad of Victorian scouts in the Dark Woods by himself. Four or five men, by using the terrain to his advantage. Said there was one child left behind, but he couldn't bring himself to finish the job. Sound about right?
[name="'The Ombudsman'"]But think about it. Why would a scout squad bring a child with them?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1749_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="'The Torturer'"]Huh? The Wakewoman already explained that. The scouts had taken hostages—a group of merchants who'd travel between Tara and Victoria—and forced them to guide them through the forest.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_234",focus="m")]
[name="'The Ombudsman'"]Sure, I buy that there was a caravan, but the <i>scouts</i>? *sighs* I don't know about that...

The mysterious woman stands up and heads to the bar. The writer leans back in his chair.
As has been his habit for many years, he sets about planning how to make the next part of his story captivating. However, as he thinks it through, a sudden tightness grips his heart.
Even if this woman is also a survivor, and even if she knows a thing or two about what happened, he cannot simply lay everything out there like he has been, at least not for this next part.
Heavens knows what she would have to say about it.
This is just a story. A shadow cast on the wall, not the fire itself. A storyteller must always remember this, or they will find themselves consumed by the flames.
