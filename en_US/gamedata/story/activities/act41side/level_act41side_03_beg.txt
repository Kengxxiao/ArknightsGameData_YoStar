The next day, the city gets the smallest of reprieves from the food shortage. No one notices that The Brigadier never returned from the Dark Woods.
The food mysteriously appear at the agricultural plate before making its way to the grain stores across the city. It falls well short of truly solving the problem.

Once again the sun rises, without pity or care.
The dragon and the wayward wakewoman walk the streets, watching with shock at how the now-commonplace brawls descend into even more brutal violence.
