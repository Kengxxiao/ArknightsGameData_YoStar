Labhréathach the fool had made too many mistakes, the likes of which you have already seen. He grew weak, and felt his end coming.
On the eve of Samhain, he came to see the brother he had not seen for twenty years, bearing the finest gifts his nomadic life would allow.
He even convinced the druids of the city, who oversaw the festival's ceremonies, to take him to his brother.
Touched by his familial love, they led him into the city. But he failed to realize when his guide's silhouette, voice, and demeanor changed, not until it was too late.
He was taken to this very corridor, and—

...
I doubt that Ailill, who gave the order to assassinate his brother, was on that balcony on the other side of the door. For my eyes were wide open until the very end, but I never saw his fire through the gaps.
Where did it all go wrong?
Was he angry that the priests continued to treat me as royalty? Did he consider me leaving without a word twenty years earlier a betrayal?
Or was it someone else who wanted me dead, and he simply had no choice?
I'll never know.
Within this brief, swift act of violence, there was only one thing that I had long known, that I had never doubted—
A red dragon never forgives. The hatred of the dragons is even longer than the history of Tara.
