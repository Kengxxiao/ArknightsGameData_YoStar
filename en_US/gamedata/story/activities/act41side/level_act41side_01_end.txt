The friendly resident puts her hand on her waist.
The ancient Tarans carried small flames at their waists, stabilized through Originium Arts, to dispel the dark mist in the marsh.
After Victoria seized full control of Tara, this custom—along with all similar practices—was strictly banned.
But times have changed. No longer bound by Victoria's rules, the Tarans, or at least the people of Na Saoirsí, have chosen to wear small Originium lamps at their waists.
