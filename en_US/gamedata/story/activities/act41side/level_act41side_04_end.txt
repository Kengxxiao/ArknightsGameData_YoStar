Loughshinny subconsciously turns her head away.
The fierce purple flames still rage in the skeleton the hero dragged all the way here. Culann, now taken over by purple flames, briefly stands up before sinking back down to kneel.
She cannot bear another look at him, so she turns her gaze back to her sister's eyes‚Äîand the hand she's been offered for so many years.
It is unclear if it is her imagination or a side effect of the purple flames depriving everything they touch of vitality, but the hand before her seems so pale and bloodless compared to the one in her memories.

[name="Nemos"]Culann was right to ask what we would do once Samhain is over. What <i>should</i> I do?
[name="Nemos"]Other than revenge, there's nothing left for me either.

As she utters these words, Loughshinny sees a flame ignite within the final Na Saoirs√≠an left untainted by the purple fire.
