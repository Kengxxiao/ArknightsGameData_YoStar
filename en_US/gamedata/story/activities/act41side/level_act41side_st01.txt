If you have ever made the journey to the Red Dragon's Lair we call Na Saoirsí, no matter how briefly, you will never forget the Dark Woods along the way.
They are dismal and damp, filled with a gloomy mist and fae who love playing tricks on men. A labyrinth of darkest black.
It is said that, of all the people who have entered, not a one has ever left without the forest's permission.
Even if it <i>does</i> open its boughs to allow you passage, the mischievous fae will still lead you astray, jeering at your clumsy movements all the while. But once they finally leave you be...

[name="Loughshinny"]This land is more than just idyllic pastures and fields.
