[name="'The Singer'"]I heard rumors of chaos in the city, so I thought there might be something I could do to help. Alas, there is not. All I've heard is that the supply shortage was caused by Victorian sabotage.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_247",focus="m")]
[name="'The Singer'"]I've only ever run into the Victorian army by accident, and you and Culann were the ones to save me at the time.
[name="'The Singer'"]Also, the information you've provided us on the wakemen has been truly fascinating—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1692_1#6$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nemos"]Ah, sorry sir, but I really don't have time to be reminiscing. But I could use your assistance. Culann's apprentice, Theo, has gone missing. Can you help me look for him?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_247",focus="m")]
[name="'The Singer'"]I am... unable to help with that.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_247",focus="m")]
[name="'The Singer'"]The cityfolk are angry enough at the Victorians to flay one alive. Why bother running around looking for a Victorian child?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1692_1#6$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nemos"]Forget it then. I'll go look myself.

[name="'The Singer'"]Remember that the celebration will start in just over an hour. Don't you need to deliver the sacred instruments symbolizing the wakemen's blessings to the venue?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1692_1#5$1",focus="m")]
[name="Nemos"]Gah!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_247",focus="m")]
[name="'The Singer'"]*Sigh* Sorry, I really must be going now.
