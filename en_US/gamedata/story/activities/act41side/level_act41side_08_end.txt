Then, she feels a sudden chill on her face.
It was a drop of water. Nemos lifts her head and looks to the distant night sky.
More look up as the damp raindrops pelt their faces, gently washing their tears away.
It is raining.

On Samhain's eve the rain falls, heavier and heavier, but the crowd still remains in the square. They wish to thank the Red Dragon for returning their lives, for separating life from death.
But the dragon tells everyone she will remain here until everyone returns home to rest.
So the people gradually disperse, and eventually even the wakemen and refugees bid goodbye to the dragon. They worry that some of the dead, who have not returned their fire yet, will gather around the ruins, although that worry is unfounded.

By the time the sun rises, no longer will there be any wandering dead on Taran soil.
Amidst sobs, Nemos bids goodbye to the dragon as well. The next day, she will wake up early to collect bricks from all over town to make a new door for Culann's workshop.
The huge square empties out, leaving only a red dragon and a nomad.

Looking at the flickering flame in the dragon's eyes, Labhréathach recalls a time centuries past. When Ailill was still a lad with a cracking voice, while his own beard had just started to sprout.

Máighréad, 'the Exquisite', was promoting everything Victorian in the royal capital, and ultimately even banned a favorite custom for Taran commoners: placing bets.
That day, Labhréathach had exploded in an argument with his mother, with an unprecedented level of rage.
Afterwards, his mother ordered him to fast and reflect, but Ailill sneaked into his brother's bedroom with a big piece of steak for him.
The brothers blew out every light in the room and merrily gorged themselves, even licking their fingers clean. 'Enough stubbornness. Soon everyone in the capital will be a Victorian.' Ailill said.
Labhréathach stroked his still-soft beard, and merely shook his head. He asked: Then why not make a bet with me? Once Mother's gone, not a soul will willingly continue pretending they're Victorian.
'Fine.' Ailill replied.
The older brother burst into laughter. 'What's on the table, then? What'd make a good wager? Why not the crown? If you win, I'll never set foot in the palace for the rest of my life.'
'No. I'll wager anything but that.'
<i>Ailill had refused.</i> It was I who insisted on having it my way, half as a joke, and half hungry for a gamble. I nearly put him in tears, didn't I?
Yes, yes. Because Ailill was always the type to give in. He'd definitely agree.
And so, in the end, he said: 'Alright. If you go, then never come back.'
Afterwards, I ended up leaving the palace, wandering for years as Ailill spent that time unhappy in the capital.
I heard that after losing half his men in the court, Ailill was controlled by not even Victorians, but Taran nobles speaking with Victorian accents.
