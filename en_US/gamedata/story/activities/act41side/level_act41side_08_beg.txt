Nemos drags the coffin out of the citadel.
Not a single soul is in the square with the statue. Curfew has begun, but she drags the red dragon's coffin over as the draconic flames burn within her own body.
Wherever she goes, the darkness retreats. Once she moves on, it re-occupies the space.

The wayward wakewoman sings with a hoarse voice, dragging the burning coffin towards every inhabited part of the city she's familiar with.
She stops at every house, making sure that the purple flames reflect in their windows, that the elegy is heard inside.
The more she sings, the more intimately the flames envelop her body, overwhelming her sluggish senses and making every step feel like torturous labor.
But it also lets her hear even the smallest snippets of speech from every window.

The juxtaposition of the giant statue with the two tiny figures makes them seem like ghosts.
But somehow, Nemos can also feel the presence of others besides Emma. In fact, they seem to have crowded the square, as if the whole city is here.
They are all watching and listening, lit up by the strange purple glow from their Originium lamps.
No, it is more than a glow... Their bodies are burning purple.

[name="Nemos"]The one who killed the Red Dragon is...
[Dialog]
[charslot]
Nemos knows they haven't changed a bit. They are still waiting for her to utter a name they can curse and then destroy. Or maybe they will even destroy themselves.
Loughshinny? No one would believe there were actually two red dragons.
Who else, then? Who else could possibly kill the dragon who seemed to toy with life and death?
Before she can stop herself, she has a thought: Why not just say it was the dark mist, or the Victorians?
'Revenge', indeed. Let these lunatics dash into the mist and die in the Red Dragon's name.
Let them fulfill their desire for vengeance, and let this violet city die. It was born in disgrace, let it die in madness.
Yes, die, let everyone who stayed perish, just like those who left and went into the dark mist—
[name="Distant Voice"]...I stepped into the dark woods one morn, calling to the mists of hoar...
Nemos turns to look at the colossal dragon skeleton sculpture, and recalls that recent evening, awash with confusion and sorrow.
What was he thinking, the man who dragged this statue into the square? What song was he singing in his heart?
Was it the song they taught Theo when they rescued him, what feels like centuries ago?
At this moment, the last bit of her sanity snatches the answer from the fiery clutches of her rage.
The answer that had been fluttering around since the very beginning of the story, the answer to the Red Dragon, to the sisters, to the mirror and reflection, and to the flames of life and death.

Bloodshot eyes that did not shut from news of the death, instead ask her questions.

Clenched fists that did not open from news of the death, instead ask her questions.
Silence, tension, confusion.
Their revenge was rejected, overruled by the Red Dragon, so where should their sorrow go now?

The wakemen and refugees slowly sing their way through the city, like a tiny stream left behind after a night of rain.
It is by no means a clear stream, nor a turbulent one. It is a miserable, muddy trickle flowing down centuries of painful history, carrying dust and blood, and about to run dry.
But it is this murky bitterness that reveals the city's true self in the gloomy night.
Nights of falling asleep gripping old photos, mornings awakened by phantom pain from amputated limbs.
Now-empty houses fell to ruin, while those fortunate enough to return home were greeted only by orphaned dolls scattered across dusty floors.

Crude, sharp, turbid, and stuck in their throats, only now does their sorrow manage to cry out.
