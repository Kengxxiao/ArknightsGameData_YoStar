Hundreds, thousands of years ago, the Tarans' ancestors did the same as their descendants do now, lighting bonfire after bonfire in the barrens between autumn and winter.
They would sleep beside the red dragon, their red-hot dreams buffeted by sand and wind until raw, but even so it was enough to keep everyone warm.
They would wake up to a still-burning bonfire, because the red dragon does not sleep.
With a moment's rest, the red dragon could find respite from fatigue and pain by breathing in the dreams of homeland, liquor, and freedom rising slowly from the flames and into the sky.
Today, Samhain approaches. The people fuel the flames with wood torn from nearby ruins, and have entirely forgotten the ancient leisure time that seemed to last forever.

In a flash, every other sound fades, leaving only the shaking of steel and gears in its wake.
Hidden in the humid mist is the gigantic silhouette of an ice-cold statue.

They finally notice the iron chains wrapped around his arms, one, two, three times around, and that the statue's weight was resting on those wide yet mortal shoulders.
The hero does not respond to his name and continues forward. The statue grinds down on him till it draws blood. His flesh is nearly rent asunder, his bones cry out in sorrow, and yet he presses on.
The young hero walks ahead of the statue, unafraid of the disparity between his small stature and the gigantic structure. He takes one step, then another, each heavy and certain, towards an open space in the crowd.

Fresh blood gushes from Culann's mouth and nose as if he has just uttered his last words.
He bears an almost kind and expectant gaze as he looks at his compatriots surrounding him. Hoping their faces will reveal an expression other than hate.
But he feels as if his eyes meet only a sea of purple flames. The faces behind the fire are difficult to discern, as if they are the restless dead he met in those ruins outside long, long ago.
He looks into the distance.

In a corner at the edge of the square he sees a tiny figure.
He did not have time to look for Theo's corpse, but now it stares at him blankly, purple flames clearly visible around it.
