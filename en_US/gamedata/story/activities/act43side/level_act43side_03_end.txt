[name="Greta"]What we lack is not skill. It's courage.
[name="Greta"]Of course, by no means have I disregarded your safety.
[name="Greta"]Before our plate departed central Wrankwood, I visited expert Catastrophologists at Trimounts University.
[name="Greta"]I obtained a detailed report, and tested the data in the plate's navigational system multiple times. The studio plate will keep a safe distance from the Catastrophe.
[name="Greta"]Access to the emergency escape landboats will remain unrestricted. Any staff member who feels their life is in danger may use them at your own discretion.
[name="Greta"]And I will be the last to leave this plate.
[name="Greta"]If there are no further questions. Dismissed.
