Miss.Christine takes a sniff, and the rushing crowd slows down in her eyes... until they freeze in place.

[name="Miss.Christine"]Panic. Bitter and hard to keep down, but a little dash of sweet comfort will turn it into a nice dessert...

[name="Miss.Christine"]Pain. The most complex and ever-changing emotion. It used to be my favorite...
[name="Miss.Christine"]But after meeting Lucian, the pain of ordinary people is almost flavorless to me.
[name="Miss.Christine"]Well, there's another one over there... She seems to be that little Zalak's friend.

Moira hears a song.
The emotions within flood into her, overwhelming even the song itself. She does not understand what Lucian is singing about, she only feels...
Joy, fear, doubt, rage, hatred, and sorrow—a hundred times stronger than her own...
Before she is completely washed away by the emotions, she cannot help but think—
What sort of experiences must one go through to understand such revelations—or was he simply forced to learn it all within the despair of having nothing at all—

Shouts and sobs, scolding and cursing, sincere prayers and subconscious wailing...
The hands of fate and the play staged by nature will not allow everyone time to take their positions.

[name="Dalton?"]Because once you push aside all the theatricality, this is what I look like when 'officially collaborating' with you again, after so many years apart.
[name="Dalton?"]How is Abyss doing? Oh, my apologies, you are more inclined to call him Shalem, I believe?

[name="Lucian"]Traveling, gathering inspiration, disaster relief... In short, he won't be showing up here.

[name="Dalton?"]Of course. The Crimson Troupe has long since ceased to exist, and I'm glad to see the both of you walk out from its haze.
[name="Dalton?"]A new role, a new life, a new home... I see the company known as Rhodes Island has provided you many a revelation.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1837_1#2$1", bstart=0.01,bend=0.4)]
[name="Dalton?"]But you? Why have you come here, child?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#1$1")]
[name="Lucian"]Should I not have?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1837_1#2$1", bstart=0.01,bend=0.4)]
[name="Dalton?"]No, no. You are our most important individual now, as the curtains are about to fall on this new play.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#1$1")]
[name="Lucian"]...I'm already on the stage, after all.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1837_1#2$1", bstart=0.01,bend=0.4)]
[name="Dalton?"]Of course, of course.
[name="Dalton?"]The marvelous scene we saw at the opening of this show was all thanks to you and him.

[name="Dalton?"]Dalton personally handed you the weapon that would kill him, and his death raised the curtains on this story.
[name="Lucian"]And you witnessed it all through his eyes.
[name="Dalton?"]Lucian, surely you felt something was off the moment you held the knife.
[name="Dalton?"]While I was relieved to confirm it...
[name="Dalton?"]I am also curious: why exactly did you swing that blade with zero hesitation...?
[name="Lucian"]Once an actor takes the stage, anything unexpected must become a part of the performance.
[name="Lucian"]Your lessons have been engraved into my mind, and nothing more—
