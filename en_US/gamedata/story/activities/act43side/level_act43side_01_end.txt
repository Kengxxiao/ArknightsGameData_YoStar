[name="Auctioneer"]For our friends joining us for the first time, if you're here for exquisite Yanese calligraphy or rare Sargonian treasures, I suggest you save yourself some time and leave now.
[name="Auctioneer"]This here is a Script Auction, unique to Wrankwood, where unfinished ideas, drafts, and their associated copyrights are up for sale.
[name="Auctioneer"]As such, unlike traditional auctions where anything put up must have its authenticity verified, we offer no guarantees as to the value of the items—
[name="Auctioneer"]Whether it has marketing potential or artistic value, whether it will become Wrankwood's next timeless classic or a forgotten flop...
[name="Auctioneer"]That is for you, and you alone, to decide.
[name="Auctioneer"]To protect the intellectual property of the items on auction, you are asked to put away your terminals and turn off any recording equipment. And without further ado, allow me to introduce the first item—
[name="Auctioneer"]<i>The Death of Lady Dupont</i>, a story of love and hatred taking place in Columbia, involving two blue-blood families in changing times. Bidding starts at one hundred thousand gold certificates.
[name="Auctioneer"]One hundred thousand. We have a bid for one hundred thousand from the gentleman in the back... One hundred and fifty thousand from the pretty young lady on my left! Anyone else?
[PlaySound(key="$d_avg_auctionhammer")] 
[name="Auctioneer"]One hundred and fifty thousand going once...
[PlaySound(key="$d_avg_auctionhammer",channel="2")]
