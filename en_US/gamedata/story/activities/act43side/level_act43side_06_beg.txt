[name="Greta"]I'm sure you have reservations, Lucian.
[name="Greta"]The plate's in a crisis, and everybody's in danger. I wouldn't trust a cold-hearted producer who is demanding the shoot go on either.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lucian"]We do not need to trust each other.

[name="Greta"]Heh. You're not wrong.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]In my twenty years in Wrankwood, I've never trusted a single person I've worked with. I trust only in my own judgment.
[name="Greta"]I invited Melanie right when she most needed an opportunity. I saw right away at that auction that you were an acting genius. And I was sure Abner would join the crew even though he hates my guts.
[name="Greta"]...I even still believe that Laura's death five years ago was the only way to save that movie.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lucian"]You had nothing to do with the accident, but you still made use of her death.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]She was a talented rookie. Eager, hardworking, and full of passion for cinema. It's just that sometimes, that enthusiasm got to her head, and made her break a few rules.
[name="Greta"]Steven was still green back then, and the shoot wasn't going as planned. Halfway through the project, I knew that film would burn through all my assets and leave my reputation in tatters.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]I needed an 'external factor' to help me solve that crisis.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lucian"]Laura's death.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]Using the media to hype up the accident would be too predictable. Those busybodies would just sigh and forget all about it the moment they moved on.
[name="Greta"]So I used a lot of money to squash the police investigation and media's attention, along with a healthy amount of hush money to Laura's family.
[name="Greta"]I got the editor to keep the footage of the fall that Abner captured on camera, and turned it into the climax of the film.
[name="Greta"]Even now, there are some people who still think she was just an acting genius who retired early.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lucian"]You covered up her death.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]I immortalized her in film.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#2$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lucian"]Someone will eventually notice what you did.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#7$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]Every year, on the day of her sacrifice, I go visit her. Five years, and I'm the only one who brings flowers to her grave.

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]I'm certainly to blame for it. But now's not the time for repentance.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]Right now, there's only one thing on my mind: finishing this film.
[name="Greta"]Once <i>The Death of Lady Dupont</i> is screening, the murders on set are bound to get the media's attention. I'll take that chance to officially release the truth behind Laura's death.
[name="Greta"]When that time comes, there will be a lot more people grieving for her. And that's when I'll bear the blame.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#3$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lucian"]......
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#8$1", focus="r")]

[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lucian"]You want to use the truth to make a deal.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]When I first met you, I thought it was fate throwing me a bone, dropping a big present on my lap before shooting started.
[name="Greta"]But it was your behavior after you joined the crew that proved to me you are no ordinary man.
[name="Greta"]Dalton died right in front of you, but you kept your cool. You even looked forward to future filming.
[name="Greta"]After you discovered my plans to film a Catastrophe, you took the perfect opportunity to leak those plans to the camera assistant most likely to spill them.
[name="Greta"]And now with the crew officially dismissed, almost everyone is feeling desperate. Except you. You were waiting in your room for me to visit, as if you're no stranger to sudden death and tragedy.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]Who are you exactly, and why did you agree to join my film crew?
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#5$1", focus="l")]
[name="Lucian"]I was enticed by your script. No more and no less.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#7$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]Sure.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#6$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]The way things are now, interrogating you about your history isn't going to help my shoot, but I was hoping you would repay my honesty in kind.
[name="Greta"]I still believe in my vision, Lucian. No matter what I find out about you, no matter how suspicious, I will never withdraw my invitation for you to be my male lead.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Greta"]But—
[name="Greta"]If you really can't explain why you're here, if you've got your sights on something way over my head...
[name="Greta"]If you think Laura's death and everything it's caused five years down the line are the real 'story' being filmed on this plate, and you're here for that...
[name="Greta"]Then I, Greta Stone, would like to invite you again.
[name="Greta"]Please be our next 'leading man', Lucian.
