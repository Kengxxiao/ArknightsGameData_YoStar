[name="Troupe Leader"]If you are referring to how you dealt with that Moira girl... then you owe me no apologies, Lucian.
[name="Troupe Leader"]With your intellect, I can only assume you've figured out the original ending of the story.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#4$1")]
[name="Lucian"]An old case from five years ago, and a Catastrophe that arrives right on cue. Both the storm and the delayed judgment rain down on this plate.
[name="Lucian"]The Zalak, who once stood outside the story, slowly walks to the center of the stage—and kills all those burdened with sin.
[multiline(name="Lucian")]Later, she comes to realize that everything she's done has been driven by delusion. She awakens—hollowed out, broken—and judges the last remaining soul—

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1829_1#3$1")]

The Troupe Leader smiles and bows towards Lucian. His scepter, wrapped by his tail, points toward the approaching Catastrophe clouds, like a pen dipped in ink.

Lucian gives a slight nod.

[name="Troupe Leader"]Originally, this middle-aged actor who resembled nothing more than a walking corpse didn't feel this scene was all that significant.
[name="Troupe Leader"]He offered up what little lucidity he could muster, summoned the last dregs of his acting instincts, recited his few remaining lines, and held out until the director called cut—all to earn just enough for another night of drinking.
[name="Troupe Leader"]He has never mourned the actress who died because of him, nor reminisced about his once spirited past. He was not even ashamed of his current sorry state.
[name="Lucian"]You manipulated him.
[name="Troupe Leader"]Indeed. Without my intervention, he would never have taken it upon himself to retrieve the swapped knife and deliver it to you.
[name="Troupe Leader"]But I never commanded him to put his chest up to the blade.
[name="Troupe Leader"]By the time you were acting opposite him, he was already fully awake, fully aware of the danger he was in.
[name="Lucian"]......
[name="Troupe Leader"]Lucian, your talent shines just as brightly in film as it did on the stage.
[name="Troupe Leader"]Your performance awakened his memories, reminding him of how great an actor he once was, of a time when he was immersed in his roles, expressing real emotions: joy, sorrow, fury, and mirth.
[name="Troupe Leader"]In that moment, 'the Messenger' slipped fully into character, while the looming threat of financial ruin warped 'Sir Dupont's' thoughts.
[name="Troupe Leader"]He had to cover up the truth. He had to do whatever it took to kill the person before him—without pausing to think that his own blade might be turned on him.
[name="Troupe Leader"]You were right there with him—you know better than anyone just how intense his fear and anger were in that moment.
[name="Lucian"]As a farewell performance, it was nearly perfect.
[name="Troupe Leader"]Indeed, death's imminent approach did not frighten him. Instead, it ignited his competitive fire, which had long been dulled by drink. He performed with unrestrained zeal. It was exhilarating!

[name="Troupe Leader"]Then there was Michael and Marion.
[name="Troupe Leader"]The philandering actor and the shrewd costume designer were found hanging above their own set, their farcical romance laid bare for all to see.
[name="Troupe Leader"]Their union was both shameful and absurd—a mess of indulgent desire, scheming ambition, mutual disdain, and mutual exploitation.
[name="Troupe Leader"]There wasn't a trace of anything real about them, inside or out. That Michael—even his ears and tail were fake.
[name="Troupe Leader"]Their deaths served no purpose, save for giving that camera assistant a juicy bit of gossip to peddle.
[name="Troupe Leader"]But you, Lucian, you were at the scene. Even the cat could taste the lingering emotions left behind.
[name="Troupe Leader"]When Moira knocked on that door, when the footsteps of death drew near, in that fleeting moment where there was no time to think, I'm sure you know what each of them did.
[name="Lucian"]Tear stains.
[name="Troupe Leader"]What a fascinating detail.
[name="Lucian"]Tear stains lingered in the corners of his eyes—none of the three Rockefeller brothers had ever shown Lady Dupont such heartfelt emotion.
[name="Lucian"]That fireman's axe was originally meant for Marion.
[name="Lucian"]Yet Michael shielded her from harm, exposing himself to the blade instead.
[name="Lucian"]In the last moments of their lives, that man and that woman, who up to that point had been attacking each other, instinctively protected each other.
