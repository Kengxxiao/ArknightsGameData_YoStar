[name="Audience Member A"]...It's over?
[name="Audience Member B"]Yup.
[name="Audience Member A"]Thoughts on the film?
[name="Audience Member B"]I heard about what happened behind the scenes—the murders, the Catastrophe, even the project management was a mess.
[name="Audience Member B"]So before I sat down to watch it, I thought the film couldn't possibly live up to all that. But...
[name="Audience Member B"]An absurd noble's marriage breakdown ending with a Catastrophe—the plot twists made sense, but so many of the characters were just bizarre...
[name="Audience Member B"]It's hard to say if it's good or bad, but it's a lot to chew on.
[name="Audience Member A"]Same, to be honest.
[name="Audience Member A"]Story aside, even the production was pretty controversial. Like, the cinematography is inconsistent at times...
[name="Audience Member A"]The first part was shot meticulously like a serious historical drama, but it becomes rougher and rougher towards the end, especially the Catastrophe scenes, where it's totally filmed like a documentary!
[name="Audience Member A"]It's definitely going to be polarizing. The fans will rate it highly, while the haters are going to <i>hate</i> it.
[name="Audience Member B"]But that's what makes it interesting, isn't it?
[name="Audience Member B"]Wrankwood's been getting more and more boring over the years, and that goes for AGFF films too...
[name="Audience Member B"]But this one? I'd buy a ticket to <i>Lady Dupont</i>.
[name="Audience Member A"]Let's see what the director and cast have to say during the post-screening round table.
[name="Audience Member A"]Oh yeah, I heard that unlucky-looking gal in the front worked on it too...

[name="Hautin"]Hoo boy... My luck is awful.
[name="Hautin"]After a month of applications, I finally landed a spot as their last stagehand, but then all of <i>that</i> happened the moment I arrived on set. I lost so much sleep after running into those corpses...
[name="Hautin"]And if it weren't for the insomnia, I wouldn't have kicked the wall with my mind all messed up, and broken my leg when I was trying to follow everyone down to safety when the Catastrophe came near...
[name="Hautin"]And if I didn't break my leg, I wouldn't have missed my bus and missed the first half of the screening...
The unlucky stagehand mutters to herself as the credits roll. She recalls her experience and cannot help but feel sorrowful about it all.
Even the images on the screen feel strange to her. The familiar faces and scenes have all been assembled in a way she cannot understand...
Just like her 'topsy-turvy' life.
Then, she spots her name at the end of the credits.
[name="Hautin"]'Stage Department: Hautin'...
No matter how the hand of fate may change, it will eventually leave a line, a truth you believe in.

[name="Playwright"]It's over. Aren't you taking part in the post-screening round table?
[name="Lucian"]I'm not with them. Besides... the two of you are here.
[name="Playwright"]Hah, true enough.
[name="Playwright"]Yes, it was wonderful... Be it the film itself or otherwise.
[name="Shalem"]Lucian...
[name="Lucian"]Hm?
[name="Shalem"]Is he dead for good this time?
[name="Shalem"]Or is he still alive somehow?
[name="Lucian"]I'd have to think about that.
[name="Lucian"]But all you need to know, Shalem, is that you won't have to worry about shadows from the past invading your dreams—even when you're on Rhodes Island—ever again.
[name="Lucian"]And Playwright, you may write your scripts as you wish. About any topic, in any style.
[name="Lucian"]The Crimson Troupe is no more. You two are free.
[name="Shalem"]......
[name="Playwright"]......
[name="Playwright"]And you?
[name="Playwright"]You just said you'd have to think about his ending—which means you're stuck on that path, correct?
[name="Playwright"]'Drama never dies'... So is the one sitting beside me right now no longer 'Blood Diamond', but 'Tragodia'?
[name="Shalem"]It sounds like you've paid a heavy price, Lucian.
[name="Lucian"]I wouldn't say so.
[Image(image="62_i11_3", screenadapt="coverall", fadetime=0.5)]
[name="Lucian"]If our previous attempts at escape or revenge were just scripts for us to follow, then now, we can finally step into the future.
[name="Lucian"]I will travel again, sing and perform again, until I am certain that what I create manages to match my joy and pain.
[Image(image="62_i11_2", screenadapt="coverall", fadetime=0.5)]
[name="Lucian"]It could be a new troupe or a new proposition, new adventures and new stories. Or, a more dazzling tomorrow, a more tragic truth...
[name="Shalem"]......
[name="Playwright"]......
[name="Playwright"]Hey, Shalem. We're all buddies here... would you like to lend him a hand?
[name="Shalem"]Lucian, a-are you sure about this?
[name="Lucian"]Of course.
[name="Lucian"]Those who've lost themselves in their haste. The ascetics who've closed off their senses and their selves. The laypeople who trudge through both highs and lows. And the creatures who chew on their pain.
[name="Lucian"]This land has never lacked for actors.
