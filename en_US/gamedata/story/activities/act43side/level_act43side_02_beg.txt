Pain is a form of mitigation.
Strange whispers, strange sights...
Except, unlike Shelly, the problem he faces is not the fear of these things, but the desire for them.

[name="Troupe Member A"]Lucian hasn't returned the Originium phonograph yet?
[name="Troupe Member B"]Nope.
[name="Troupe Member B"]He must be anxious. Didn't Whiteflower say he's had trouble sleeping?
[name="Troupe Member B"]Too much superficiality in his ecstasy and anguish. He doesn't understand more complex, more extreme emotions. It limits his performances.
[name="Troupe Member A"]But he's young. Why the rush?
[name="Troupe Member B"]It's been six or seven years since Lucian joined. With his beautiful voice, he was considered a rising star at first, and the leader instructed him personally.
[name="Troupe Member B"]But he's hit a wall now that he's finally in a lead role.
[name="Troupe Member A"]Listening to those records won't solve anything!

Lucian destroyed his own voice.
Originium pours into the wound, and he is inundated in pain and despair.
