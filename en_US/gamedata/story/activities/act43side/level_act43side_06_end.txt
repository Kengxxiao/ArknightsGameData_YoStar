[name="Moira"]So, out of all the choices Miss Stone gave us after disbanding the crew, you chose to play detective, Lucian.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#1$1")]
[name="Lucian"]No need to bluff. I know you're not afraid of me exposing you.
[name="Lucian"]If it would let more people know the truth behind Laura's death and the conduct of the film crew, you would have gladly exposed yourself, given the right opportunity.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1831_1#14$2")]
[name="Moira"]...But not right now.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#1$1")]
[name="Lucian"]It's over, Moira.
[name="Lucian"]You hid yourself well. A simple identity and an innocent facade were the ideal cover for you.
[name="Lucian"]During nearly all of the murders, you were with Tippi. That painter trusts you deeply, and was always happy to provide you an alibi... even as you left your meetings partway through.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#5$1")]
[name="Lucian"]Looking back, every 'accident' has involved you in some way.
[name="Lucian"]Dalton's death was caused by a prop knife being switched, which led to the former prop master being dismissed. You, naturally, took over his work, which afforded you even greater opportunities for crime.
[name="Lucian"]As for the second 'accident'...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#6$1")]
[name="Greta"]When Shelly walked into cold storage.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#5$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#1$1")]
[name="Lucian"]Do you remember how Shelly had a hallucination and interrupted the shoot, Madam Stone?
[name="Lucian"]While she was rooted in place, unable to move, a heavy container fell from above.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#3$1")]
[name="Greta"]You saved her. Moira single-handedly held onto the rope, preventing the two of you from being harmed...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#2$1")]
[name="Lucian"]But it was not out of the kindness of her heart.
[name="Lucian"]At the time, everyone was focused on Shelly's antics. Very few people noticed the dangling container—
[name="Lucian"]Let alone rushed to the other end of the rope.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#5$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1831_1#14$2")]
[name="Moira"]I knew her deepest nightmares.
[name="Moira"]She mistook me for my sister Laura, and babbled all her sinful secrets to me.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1831_1#15$2")]
[name="Moira"]But even to the very end, she never repented. Instead, she began to blame Laura for crossing the line... She had to die.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#1$1")]
[name="Lucian"]As for Marion and Michael...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1831_1#14$2")]
[name="Moira"]Michael only ever treated me as an innocent little errand girl. He never figured out I was after his life, even entrusting me with the important matter of sneaking out of the plate.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1831_1#15$2")]
[name="Moira"]And Marion? She never felt the slightest guilt for what happened five years ago. She HAD to die!
[dialog]

[name="Moira"]Escape? Nobody can escape!
[name="Moira"]Do you know just how much suffering and malice my sister had to endure? Yet all she ever talked about was how much experience she was getting, and how happy she was to be part of the cast.
[name="Moira"]Whenever I was worried I wouldn't make it as a prop-maker, whenever I silently shed tears as the crew ostracized me... she would use herself as an example to comfort me, to encourage me...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1831_1#16$2")]
[name="Moira"]But it was only after she died that I learned what that 'experience' you gave her really was!

[name="Moira"]Surely you haven't forgotten how you bribed the police and the media and suppressed the news of Laura's death. You even turned her accident into a mockery of the truth in a movie! How could she possibly rest in peace after that?!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#2$1")]
[name="Lucian"]No, Moira.
[name="Lucian"]Madam Stone has not forgotten her deeds. Rather, she is doubting your identity.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1834_1#6$1")]
[name="Greta"]Five years ago, after the accident, I gave Laura's family compensation.
[name="Greta"]I even hired people to scour her entire family history and their circumstances, all so I could guarantee that none of them would leak the truth, not even her most distant relatives.
[name="Greta"]After Lucian told me the truth he had deduced, I was still in disbelief, so I pulled out the list of Laura's family members and checked it again...
[name="Greta"]I regret to inform you... There was no 'Moira' on that list.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1831_1#16$2")]

She does not know if the man named Lucian will catch up to her, or how long it would take.
The room shakes violently, letting her know that the sabotage she performed had taken effect—
The cockpit is destroyed, the engine's output is locked to its highest setting, and its route is set. The studio plate speeds up as it approaches the nearby Catastrophe... and shows no signs of stopping.
In a few hours, they will find themselves with the misfortune of facing a storm... No, a trial.
The vast majority of this cast and crew had to answer for the accident five years ago...
For the death of her sister.

[name="Moira"]You could peel an entire apple without breaking its skin in thirty seconds. Whenever you were happy, you'd whistle a big strong 'phweet'. You'd use Arts to make small ice crystals to use as hair clips...
[name="Moira"]You told me about your life in Wrankwood, how your very first role got edited down to only three seconds of screentime in the final cut.
[name="Moira"]You told me about how much you struggled just to get a few more scenes. While a few assholes talked about you behind your back, most of the crew still looked after you.
[name="Moira"]You told me how, even though you came from a small town where you couldn't even buy a VCR, even though you had to learn a lot of things from scratch, even though opportunities that are easy for others to get are far out of reach for us...
[name="Moira"]We still shouldn't be discouraged.
[name="Moira"]You never mentioned how much bullying you had to suffer through, how much pain you endured. You would go on and on about how beautiful the sunrise in Wrankwood was, looking towards the future with such firm eyes.
[name="Moira"]You also had times when you were sad, even though you only ever mentioned how homesick you felt at night, when all was quiet and the only ones kept you company were the twin moons low in the sky.
[name="Moira"]You told me how alike we were, and how you had my back and would support me forever.
[name="Moira"]Ever since we were little—
Moira suddenly stops.
She shakes her head like mad, trying to force more details out of her memory.
But she can say no more. She finds her memories of Laura have an unusually distinct cutoff point.
They had never run through the grass together, hand in hand. They had never fallen asleep in each other's arms as their parents sang to them.
As she trawls further back through her memories, every image to do with her sister is simply blank.

It is the sound of walls and metal structures being squashed as flat as an empty can, one after the other.
It is a sound that instills extreme terror in oh-so-fragile humans, who begin to worry their organs, bones, and blood vessels will suffer a similar fate.
