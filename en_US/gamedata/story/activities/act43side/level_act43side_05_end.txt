[name="Melanie"]But in the end, Wrankwood's Best Actress Melanie Rutherford let it all go to her head, swayed by the endless praise of the critics, the flattery of the sponsors, and the applause of the audience.

[name="Melanie"]Marianne could switch from a hardened soldier to a poor servant girl and back again at the drop of a hat. A single dress rehearsal was all she needed to figure out the ideal lighting and positions.
[name="Melanie"]But if I were ever to take a single day off, spend one hour less on studying the script, or arrive at the rehearsal fifteen minutes late, my performance would fall into the gutter.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1830_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Melanie"]A mere two years of living in indulgence was all it took for me to lose the skills I once picked up with ease. I disappointed both the directors and the fans.

[name="Melanie"]You're right. I've spent more than a decade piecing my self-confidence and acting skills back together. I could very well be but a single step away from the top again.
[name="Melanie"]Greta's offer to give me the part of Lady Dupont couldn't have come at a better time, and now, even her grand ambitions have left me a special little 'gift'.
[name="Melanie"]Come to think of it, the Lady is a rather fitting role for me.
[charslot(slot = "left", name = "avg_npc_1830_1#4$1",focus="l")]
[name="Melanie"]Surely she knows her brother is lying to her? Surely she has doubted her last name once or twice?

[name="Greta"]You have the most potential of any actor I've ever seen.
[name="Greta"]The Messenger doesn't have much screentime, but your performance added a complex and delicate core to a role that was originally a nothingburger.
[name="Greta"]And I'm sure that whatever your goal here is, you won't be leaving before the shoot ends.
[name="Greta"]If so, then why not do me a favor and help me out with this?

[name="Greta"]I'll give you time to think it over, of course. So far, it's just a thought I had, and I haven't spoken to Steven about it yet.

[name="Steven"]But...
[name="Steven"]I see you've added a lot of direction notes for his lines. Most of them are... <i>quite detailed</i>.
[name="Steven"]While you were giving me advice on my writing just now, you mentioned the quirks of Lucian's performances, and where he likes to put pauses in dialogue.
[name="Steven"]You even told me which angle suits him best for close-ups to capture his most subtle expressions, and what kind of lighting best highlights his unique character...
[name="Steven"]It's like you've known him for a long, long time. Maybe even taught him—
[name="Steven"]So how did you know all these things about Lucian?
