[name="Lucian"]Calais was a Gaulish border city.
[name="Lucian"]When the allied nations suddenly turned on them, Calais was thrown under siege. Yet thanks to its powerful cannons—and the general hailed as the 'Imperial Standard-Bearer'—Calais held fast for months.
[name="Lucian"]The general stood atop the wall—refusing sleep, refusing rest, refusing to give ground. With their banner still flying high, even the weariest soldiers held the line.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#6$1", focus="r")]

[name="Troupe Leader"]The Emperor of Gaul had given up on Calais, as by then its fate was sealed.
[name="Troupe Leader"]The Imperial Standard-Bearer had refused to surrender out of honor, and the trusted lieutenant believed he ought to stand by his general. After all, they had already braved so many life-or-death situations together over the decades.
[name="Troupe Leader"]But he knew that holding the line would only lead to more bloodshed—that the city was doomed to become a graveyard.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1829_1#3$1", focus="l")]
[name="Troupe Leader"]Perhaps that battle-worn soldier simply realized that although there was no perfect choice, there was a way that would allow him to atone for his sins.
[name="Troupe Leader"]He persuaded the general, who had long since become exhausted, to take a ten minute break. Then he seized his opportunity to open the gate.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1829_1#1$1", focus="l")]
[name="Troupe Leader"]Before the allied forces could enter the city, he drove his sword through his own heart... That traitor ended up being the most tragic casualty of the war.

[name="Lucian"]Over 200 years ago, a brilliant cardinal was struck down by gun-knights in the plaza in front of the Basilica.
[name="Lucian"]He was intelligent and compassionate, known as 'the Sankta closest to the Lord.' At just thirty years old, he was already widely regarded as the Pope's heir apparent.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#5$1", focus="r")]
[name="Lucian"]But then, he changed. He grew radical, unyielding, unwieldy. He started preaching, rallying followers, and reaching out to foreign envoys, all in an attempt to check the Pope's authority.
[name="Lucian"]...Until the situation deteriorated into a religious coup that threatened the entire city-state. The Pope was critically wounded, and the gun-knights were deployed. The would-be usurper became the only cardinal in the history of Laterano to die during a coup.
[name="Lucian"]No one knows what exactly happened to him... At some point, in one of the Ecclesia Requietum, he had a chance encounter with a passing Feline—but of course, that is hardly a lead worth chasing.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_npc_1829_1#12$1", focus="l")]

[name="Troupe Leader"]I merely offered that Sankta a bit of 'truth'—he was already terminally ill, you know.
[name="Troupe Leader"]Unlike the incompetent Pope, who knew only how to interpret scriptures, his own zealousness knew no bounds. But with limited time, he might not have been able to put his ideals into practice, to hear the church bells ring in the new era.
[name="Troupe Leader"]But in truth, the moment the cardinal struck down the Pope, he came to his senses. He realized that death had never caught up with him after all.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1828_1#8$1", focus="r")]

Greta helps hold Steven steady as they both come to a stop, and he looks to the side.
There is a wall, only half of it still standing. Faint remnants of vivid graffiti stand out harshly against the grimy, dim surroundings.
It is the giant promotional mural Tippi had painted for the crew, and by some stroke of luck, the title card remains unscathed amidst all the wind and flying debris—
<i>The Death of Lady Dupont</i>.

[name="Melanie"]That's why I care so much about seniority, status, and etiquette. The aspects of film set culture that so many scoff at... Because that sort of recognition is the reward I deserve as an ordinary person.
[name="Melanie"]This land is quite cruel to ordinary people, Abner.
[name="Melanie"]Marianne's retirement gave me the chance to step into the spotlight, but it took only a single slip-up for me to lose everything I'd gained along the way.
[name="Melanie"]My acting skills have fallen off a cliff. My reputation is a shambles. I've tried everything I could think of, but I just couldn't seem to get it back...
[name="Melanie"]It's ridiculous! I've never wanted to admit this, but it's true... If Marianne hadn't retired, I'd never have caught up to her!
[name="Melanie"]And right this very moment, this Catastrophe is destroying the entire plate, along with my last hope.
[name="Melanie"]But couldn't you also say fate is smiling upon me?
[name="Melanie"]At least I finally have the courage... to let go of my inhibitions, the courage to...
[name="Melanie"]At least I finally mustered the courage to take this first leap.
[name="Melanie"]Come to me, Lady Dupont. Come with Melanie Rutherford, and dance together with the Catastrophe...

Tragodia is uncharacteristically silent, his eyes fixed on the face in front of him that is lost in emotion.
Lucian shouts loudly. The raging storm does not even distort his voice in the slightest. He sings, and chants—while the Originium crystals creep visibly along his neck.
[name="Tragodia"]Does it hurt, child?
[name="Lucian"]Ngh—
[name="Lucian"]Yes. Of course it hurts.
[name="Tragodia"]If you keep using your Arts without restraint, it will kill you, child.

Lucian responds to Tragodia with even greater fervor. His surging emotions give him newfound strength, and at last, he seizes the upper hand in their clash. In an instant, he plunges the scepter into Tragodia's torso.

The plate beneath their feet is swaying and shaking, but is starting to stabilize.
People start to poke their heads out from the ruins and look at the receding disaster. They can hardly believe the Catastrophe they have just experienced.
Hundreds of broken masks drop to the ground, as Tragodia slowly falls to his feet.
Lucian is sure that he has pierced Tragodia's heart and completed his grand, murderous drama. However, he also notices a change in himself.

The silver-white hem of his robe flutters in the wind, brushed by grains of sand, yet spotless as ever. Lucian silently studies the elegant garment—
It is flamboyant and exquisite and fits him perfectly—as if it had been tailored just for him. He could walk into any festival or onto any stage in it, and it would suit him perfectly.
It is as if this is the Catastrophe's gift to him, his reward for slaying his teacher.
The theme of this murder was clearly 'betrayal', yet at the last moment it became a 'passing of the torch'?
Lucian is silent.
The fallen Tragodia has disappeared. Where he once lay, there is only blood, and his mask. The dark red carpet extends upward along the steps, without end.
This is the path he was meant to walk, and it is now free of all obstacles. These thoughts spring to Lucian's mind from nowhere.

So he climbs the stairs without lowering his head or looking back.
Just then, he hears Tragodia's voice.
[name="Tragodia"]Lucian, you are the finest actor in the land. You have honed your craft well, and you use your powers of reason to grasp hold of the mask of emotions.
[name="Tragodia"]You know well my origins, so it should be clear to you that you have not ended me by merely killing me.
[name="Tragodia"]You shouldn't pin your hopes on a scene that was once performed in an ancient castle.
[name="Tragodia"]——
[name="Tragodia"]Or is it that you were certain I would think this way—make this choice?
[name="Tragodia"]Haha. It's all so interesting.
[name="Tragodia"]Maybe you were right. Death is the one shore I will never reach, the one performance I can never take part in, and the one art I can never embody.

[name="Tragodia"]'Death or destruction' is the greatest gift you could ever give your teacher.
[name="Tragodia"]But have you considered that what you now reject—and what I've left behind—is only one of theater's countless possibilities, one of the many ways beauty can be defined?
[name="Tragodia"]And therefore, that what you've just killed was but one of my thousands of existences?
[name="Lucian"]Go on.
[name="Tragodia"]Life rushes by, but the theater endures.
[name="Tragodia"]The theater will never perish, and aesthetics will always change, so therefore I will always stand at the pinnacle of everything.

[name="Lucian"]I can become the new one—the new you?

[name="Lucian"]Then I accept it.
[name="Tragodia"]You see, Lucian? Once again, we've entered into a tacit agreement. Haha!
[name="Tragodia"]Continue forward. Climb to the highest point on the stage.
[name="Tragodia"]You shall wear the crown of 'performance'. You shall wield the scepter of 'inspiration'. You shall wear the years of performing and being performed.
[name="Tragodia"]This process will only add to your pain, but you must accept it.
[name="Tragodia"]Child, you shall walk from here with both my blessing and my curse.
[name="Tragodia"]I have fulfilled the promise I made to you when we first met: I will never be an obstacle to you... or an obstacle to theater.
[name="Tragodia"]This is my final gift to you.

Lucian does not answer, and the sound finally stops.
He stands at the top of the stairs. The storm is far away now, and blood trails behind him.
He loves this desolate scene, he loves the unformed Arts in his body, and he stretches out all his pain.
