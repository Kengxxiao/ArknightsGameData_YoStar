[name="Greta"]But more space means more costs. According to the contract, extending the lease will result in an expensive penalty—

Lucian looks down at his hands.
The blood on his gloves has been washed away, but he remembers the feeling of taking Dalton's knife out of his hands.
Fascination, revelry.
The complex emotions he felt when he was taught to use a dagger for the first time.
Forget complicated assassination techniques. Ignite the ego with intense emotion, until all that is left is two souls tearing at one another.
Let life converge upon the knife of truth and falsehood, and bestow upon the target the perfect ending—
Death.
