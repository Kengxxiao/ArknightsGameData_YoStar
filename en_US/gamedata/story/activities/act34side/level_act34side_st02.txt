[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#10$1")]
[name="Jordi"]My parents were just Ægirs 'rooted' to the land. There are plenty of us across Iberia and the other terrestrial countries. Strictly speaking, we don't even count as...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#7$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#2$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#8$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]True, I did miss the mark, but I never engage in baseless speculation.

[name="Jordi"]A bond?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#4$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]The Profound Silence ruined Iberia. The lighthouses fell dark along the coast, and doubt and suspicion grew in their shadow.
[name="Ulpianus"]Breogan was forced to flee the splendor he himself had designed. Gran Faro was one place he sheltered while on the run. The research notes your parents left you are undoubtedly connected to him.
[name="Ulpianus"]They were people he knew he could entrust his life's work to.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#8$1")]

[name="Jordi"]I...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#8$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Milliarium is the first Ægirian city you visited and, coincidentally, the last Breogan stopped at before leaving the country entirely.
[name="Ulpianus"]His trail covers the entire seabed, and everywhere he went he visited those of great repute to share his thoughts on dry land, his conjectures on Terra's future.
[name="Ulpianus"]He had hoped someone would head for the continent with him, so that one day land and sea might stand against crisis together, seek new possibilities together.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#2$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Many admired him for his talent, but perhaps his suggestions were too ahead of his time, for in the end hardly any responded to his invitation.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#8$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]In Milliarium, he even volunteered to take part in this tower's reconstruction, in exchange for an audience with the then consul.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1380_1#5$1")]
[name="Jordi"]And?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#4$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#8$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]But as the work finished, he made the final decision to wrap up his winding tour and officially depart for the faraway soils.

[name="Jordi"]...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4145_Ulpia_1#8$1")]
[name="Ulpianus"]Think over what you've done. You left the town you knew, and came to this alien place they call your home. That, too, took incredible courage.
[name="Ulpianus"]In this respect, you and Breogan are not dissimilar. Conversely, if all you'd shared was just blood, then <i>that</i> would have been something to be ashamed of.

Gladiia turns the instant she barks the order, her lance piercing the Seaborn ahead as ruptured tissues bursts about like blood.

Finally, the tide receding, the nest temporarily bares the truth of its transformation.
Seaborn living and dead fall into every ravine in the seabed. The nest's borders have begun to bleach, chitin coming together into a thick crust.

Ulpianus is pensive.
He does not turn to look at the culprit of all this, lying motionless on the floor. He stares closely at the holographic sea chart. Dots representing the Seaborn swarm converge right on Milliarium's coordinates.
