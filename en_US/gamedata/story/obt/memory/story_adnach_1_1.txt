A few days later...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Laid-Back Baron"]We've been discussing this for days, Lord Viscount. It's time we came to a decision.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Laid-Back Baron"]Something as trivial as whether to kick a bunch of Infected out has already caused me to miss three performances that I was looking forward to.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_176")]
[name="Scathing Baron"]YOU were the one who proposed to have a Rhodes Island office in the county, and YOU were the one who persuaded the Lord Viscount to let those patients in.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_176")]
[name="Scathing Baron"]Are you trying to pretend all that didn't happen?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Laid-Back Baron"]I always have the best interests of the county at heart.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Laid-Back Baron"]Rhodes Island is a pharmaceutical company with a bright future. Working with them can only be a positive for the county. Indeed, medical care in the county has improved considerably in the past two years.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Laid-Back Baron"]As for the patients, it's not like the undeveloped plate was doing anything useful just being left to collect dust. Much better to do Rhodes Island a favor and collect on it later.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Laid-Back Baron"]Besides, remind me who's been talking about developing the new plate and doing exactly nothing about it?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Laid-Back Baron"]I would hardly have proposed to use it to house the patients if it was doing anything useful.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_176")]
[name="Scathing Baron"]H—How DARE you! I bet you're behind those people stirring up the masses and talking about using the patients to develop the new plate!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Laid-Back Baron"]Would you believe me if I said I wasn't?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_176")]
[name="Scathing Baron"]Hmph. Whatever you're planning, I can tell you—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_176")]
[name="Scathing Baron"]Those patients couldn't possibly have the capability to develop the new plate.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Laid-Back Baron"]You and I can say whatever we want. At the end of the day, it's the Lord Viscount's word that counts.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_175")]
[name="Reserved Viscount"]Rufus. I listened to you about Rhodes Island, and they have indeed generated considerable economic value for the county.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_175")]
[name="Reserved Viscount"]I hear that some of the people are now in favor of allowing them to stay on the new plate... if they help us develop the new plate.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_175")]
[name="Reserved Viscount"]But this notion is not realistic. What can a rabble of patients possibly achieve?
