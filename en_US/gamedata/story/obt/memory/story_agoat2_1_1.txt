[name="Adele"]It took me some time to reach Unna Village, located near Mount Unna, because the village had been relocated a few kilometers north of its previous site.
[name="Adele"]From their current location, I can't see Mount Unna in any direction. The ruins of the old Unna Village are only visible from a great distance when viewed from their tallest rooftop.
[name="Adele"]The mountain road is long and rugged. I'm glad I requested transport for the survey. The incubator is undamaged, and the Volcano Watcher buds inside are in good condition. The experiment can commence right away.
[name="Adele"]But for some reason... The villagers are acting very strange.
[name="Adele"]When I first stepped into the village, they thought I was a lost traveler and welcomed me with enthusiasm.
[name="Adele"]But as soon as I introduced myself as a volcano surveyor, their expressions immediately went cold and they refused to say another word.

Adele sets her pen down and looks into the distance. The new Unna Village is livelier than ever, compared to the images of a village engulfed in volcanic ash she saw on the news a few years ago.
Villagers bustle about. Some strum instruments, and singing drifts from a few houses. Children run happily down the streets, casting curious glances at Adele.
Far, far away at the foot of Mount Unna are those ashen, seemingly lifeless ruins she saw in the news reports. Though darkish gray, they stand out from their surroundings.
Adele looks around, but ultimately finds her gaze fixed on those ruins.

[name="Adele"]If I can isolate the substance causing these changes, I might be able to incorporate it into early warning kits with greater sensitivity and accuracy. Perhaps the day of precise volcanic disaster warnings isn't so far off.

Adele squats down, the slightly oversized protective coat that had accompanied her on many volcanic journeys enveloping her like a tender embrace.
Puffs of hot air rise from the volcanic rocks, gently drying the tears streaming down her face as if warm hands were comforting her.
She caresses the warm stones, whispering to herself the thoughts she had longed to share.
[name="Adele"]Mutti, Vati, I surveyed three more volcanoes this year. That makes more than thirty I've been to.
[name="Adele"]Professor Keller and I have been continuing your research, and filled in many of the blanks. One by one, I'm answering the questions that you left behind.
[name="Adele"]Oh yes, since I found the Volcano Watchers, I've been trying to cultivate them. I'm also researching the link between their color changes and Originium activity. As it turns out, this is the most suitable location.
[name="Adele"]That's why I brought the flowers here... Oh, but I don't have them with me. The lambs brought me here so suddenly...

A Volcano Watcher bud appears before Adele.
[name="Adele"]Huh?
The tiny creature holds the plant gently in its mouth by the stem. The rest of the lambs playfully nudge the bud towards Adele.
She takes the flower she has painstakingly cultivated, its frail form standing proudly against the sun's last rays. With gentle determination, Adele begins to dig a hole with her hand.
Her coat's sleeves are again covered in dirt and ash, but instead of brushing it away, she stays focused on planting this young Volcano Watcher into the soil here.

[name="Katia"]Good idea. We can give it to Adele once we're done with it. She loved the freshly picked veggies we brought back last time.
[name="Katia"]I'm sure she'll love the flower, too.

A new set of footprints appears on the ground as Adele continues her journey upward, with an excited little lamb at her side.
[name="Adele"]I can't stop now... when I'm this close to the summit.
[name="Adele"]The view is splendid at the top... I'll see it for all of us, Mutti and Vati.
