Ognisko seems to have become awfully quiet.
In the past, the sound of metal banging on metal would be echoing through the city at this hour, and Obina would be humming a random tune to match the rhythm of it. It was a reassuring kind of noise.
Now, however, the only thing she hears is the rustling of leaves.
Is it because all the smiths have agreed to close their shops? But why are even the fowlbeasts silent?
Suddenly, Viviana hears a familiar voice in the distance—
'Glorious Shield Industries military products, guaranteed to help you conquer the wilderness and repel any Catastrophes!'

From the deck of the nomadic platform, McKee casts his gaze towards the wilderness in the distance.
A faint flame flickers in the darkness. In its light, Viviana's green cape looks like a ghost, drifting in the wind.
At least, that is how he would describe it, if he were writing a poem.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_212_1")]
[name="McKee"]She's gone.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1")]
[name="Obina"]She'll be back.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_212_1#3")]
[name="McKee"]Her outfit...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1")]
[name="Obina"]I had someone make it for her when she was living in Ognisko. A knight's garb isn't exactly for everyday use.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_212_1")]
[name="McKee"]I thought she would disassociate herself completely from Ognisko.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1")]
[name="Obina"]Before she left, she asked me whether I truly felt happy when we were hammering iron together by the forge.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1")]
[name="Obina"]I was happy. Of course I was.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1")]
[name="Obina"]She said she was too. And she said that was enough.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1255_1#1$1")]
[name="Obina"]Then, she asked me to take out that outfit and help her put it on.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_212_1#2")]
[name="McKee"]'Henceforth, Viviana's poems shall only be of herself'...
