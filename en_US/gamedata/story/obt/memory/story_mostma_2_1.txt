Mostima comes before the statue that stands in the middle of the ruins, carefully removes a broken piece, and takes a sniff of it.
Then, she bends down and picks up a handful of soil, and takes a sniff from it as well.
It is as she thought.
The secret to this 'scent of the town' is simple—
It is a mingled scent of the soil and the stone used in sculpting.
And there is no great secret to why the townsfolk found it familiar. It has the freshness that the vegetation left in the soil, and the unique mineral scent of the stone.
The townsfolk have lived side-by-side with these scents all their lives, which combined to become a scent that brought back memories to the people who lived here.

When she arrived on scene, what she saw was a gravely injured Lemuen, and a crazed Andoain who had committed the act.
She sensed many emotions in that instant—bewilderment, hysteria, alongside relief and acceptance.
It put a doubt in her heart, but did not stop her from acting.
To stop Andoain, she had to knock the Lock and Key from his hand with her patron firearm. She left with Lemuen after retrieving the Lock and Key.
They returned to Laterano, accompanied by Fiammetta.

[Delay(time=1)]
After that, the Lock and Key were taken from her, and she was put under house arrest.
She did not regret her fall. It was what Andoain saw in the Lock and Key that she was more concerned about.
She made the bold decision to break into the Curia.
Miss this chance, and the secret may elude her forever.

Infiltrating the Curia was not easy, but she succeeded.
Thinking back now, the white-bearded old man must have had a hand in it. He would hardly have allowed Mostima to keep the Lock and Key otherwise.
Whatever the reason, she was once again in possession of the Lock and Key.
The Lock and Key did not react when she took them from Andoain.
This time, when she touched them again with questions in her heart, she walked into a fantastical plane.
There, she saw—
A gap in the past. A cross-section of the future.
[Dialog]
[Blocker(a=0, r=0, g=0, b=0, fadetime=0, block=true)]
[Blocker(a=1, r=0, g=0, b=0, fadetime=2, block=true)]
She has a pretty good guess as to what Andoain saw.
When she saw what she saw on that plane, she immediately understood why Andoain went mad.
After all, Andoain was always worried about the future, always lamenting over the smallest of tragedies.
In a way, she could even say that Fiammetta's anger at Andoain's actions was born out of Fiammetta's approval of him—
Considering Fiammetta's sense of justice, it is no wonder that she always held Andoain in high regard for the concern he showed for others, in comparison to Fiammetta herself, who always seemed a little aloof and removed.
However, Mostima was not obsessed with the reasons for Andoain's madness. It was not simply because of the emotions that she sensed from the pair at that instant.
Instead, it is because she had a feeling, a feeling that she had perhaps harbored from the moment she joined Andoain's squad, even the moment she first saw Andoain—
They were walking divergent paths, and it was inevitable that they must go their separate ways.
It was like the many thousands of pieces before her eyes, each one potentially revealing the answer to a question. Perhaps the answer to the ultimate question will reveal itself when all the pieces are exhausted.
Andoain will choose to walk toward those pieces without hesitation, stepping into the dark mire where the stars shine.
As for her—she chose to turn back.

Mostima turns around at the hillside.
She can see the town square in the distance.
Susan and Melissa have already started their preparations. A crowd has assembled to watch them, and it is growing bigger.
The red hair of a certain Sankta stands out in the crowd. She goes from one side to another, helping out here and there, seemingly having forgotten why she was here in the first place.
For once, Mostima is not wearing her hood. She lets the breeze brush against her cheeks and run through her hair.
