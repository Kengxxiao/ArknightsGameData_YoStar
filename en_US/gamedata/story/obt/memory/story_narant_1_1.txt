The red-headed Kuranta climbs out of the sand hole, looking quite the worse for wear. She is wearing a burdenbeast skull on her foot, having stepped right through the top of it.
She turns around to yell at the empty desert, hardly bothering to even pat the dust and sand off herself.
She does not even know whom she is yelling at, but the more she thinks about it, the angrier she gets. She pulls the skull off her foot and throws it far away.
