Before she left the jungle, Gavial thought the most glaring thing that existed was the sun.
Once, she mustered the courage to stare directly at the sun, and it burned her eyes, leaving her seeing double for days.
She thought there could be nothing more glaring that the sun.
She realized she was wrong when she left the jungle.
The most glaring thing is the eyes of other people, staring at the Originium crystals on her body.
She was not afraid of the malice in those eyes, but they are always averted when she tries to look into them.
It took some time for her to learn that her illness was known as 'Oripathy', rather than 'Stone Disease'. And people like her were known as 'Infected'.
She learned that Oripathy was considered incurable.
She learned that most Infected lead hard lives.
In the jungle, there was no such distinction, no discrimination against those afflicted by Oripathy.
She did not understand why. All she knew was that she might be able to make the lives of Oripathy patients better, even if it could never be cured.
So she searched for doctors who claimed to be able to treat Oripathy, trying to learn from them.
But she found only disappointment.
Some were mere frauds. Others were worse, using the treatment of Oripathy patients as a cover for criminal activity.
When she pointed it out, they framed her and made her a fugitive.
Why?
...
She feels the pain of a needle going into her arm, then the feeling of loss as her blood is drawn.
Her friends in Acahualla do not even know what happened to her.
She should have gone back to see them, just once.
The sense of loss is soon gone.
Then, silence.
Is this death?
Do Vampires kill painlessly?
......
...
...
No. She is still alive!

[charslot(slot="m",name="char_187_ccheal_1#2")]
