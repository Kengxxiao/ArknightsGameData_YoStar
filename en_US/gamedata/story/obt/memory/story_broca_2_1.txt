Broca's room is not particularly tidy for an operator.
Not that it is exceptionally messy, but it is filled with things. Parts, plans, and tools are scattered over the floor, on the desk, and even on the bed.
It is more workshop than dorm room.
Most prominent is the workbench in a corner.
Broca had earned recognition for his skills after joining Rhodes Island, and the Engineering Department had prepared a work area for him in its workshop.
But he turned the offer down, preferring to work in his own room.
So the Engineering Department instead provided him with a workbench and soundproofed his room.
Normally, Broca gets straight to work after returning to his room.
But he does not do so today, instead sitting on his chair and taking a look around the desk.
Numerous designs have been placed around the desk, all depicting his multi-function drill.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_356_broca_1#5$1")]
