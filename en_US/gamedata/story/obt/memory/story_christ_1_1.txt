Long, long ago, the legends of this land spoke of a 'Black Cat'.
They said only the chosen ones could see Her, and that She would bring love and joy while also punishing the wicked. Though some would rather believe the Black Cat was inauspicious, and a harbinger of misfortune.
But the Black Cat only wandered to Her whims, and once she was tired, she rested wherever She was.

The prince sneers, draws his blade, and with a single swing slices the door open, along with the finery carried by the messenger standing behind the door.
The black cat stands, excited to see the sword-wielding prince. Her eyes light up, a rare sight, flashing a blue as deep as the night sky.

The messenger long gone, all that remains scattered on the floor before the entrance is tattered finery concealing chains, linked to iron weights prepared by the new king in case the prince had refused.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1496_1#1$1")]
[name="Prince"]He planned to shackle both my limbs and life in iron? Then I shall use them to destroy his life in return.

The black cat leaps down from the windowsill, showing an unprecedented level of interest. The morning light casts Her figure as a huge shadow on the ground, as if guiding the prince where to go.
All the way to the palace.

[charslot]
[name="Nervous Crowd"]Heavens, from where does he draw his strength...?!
The prince does not say a word, only dashing ahead with his head tucked down.
He runs out from his little hideout, across the garden he frolicked in as a child, past the courtyard where his parents accompanied him during swordplay training, and through the hall where they met their demise.
He runs, until he reaches his usurper uncle.

The prince whips the iron chain originally meant to bind his own hands around the usurper's neck.
He uses the iron weights meant to encumber his own feet to viciously pound the splendidly-dressed murderer's chest.
His fate was to be fixed with lies and malice by the one before him, so he uses the same method to rewrite the man's fate instead.
He thrusts his sword deep into his enemy's body.

No one manages to loosen the tightly wrapped chains, until the king's neck is snapped, his limbs and body smashed, and his rigid corpse slowly slips from the throne he was clinging to and crumples to the ground.
The prince finally lets go of his blade, and smiles with satisfaction.

But he also notices the blood on his own body—
The soldiers have pierced his limbs and torso with their weapons, sending blood spilling onto the floor.
The prince chokes, and looks up at the blue sky.
Mrow.
He sees that black cat once more.
He hears all sorts of voices.
[charslot]
[name="???"]It's the Black Cat, isn't it? She enticed him, turned him into a madman... Not only did She kill his parents, She even killed his uncle who wished to take him under his wing!
[charslot]
[name="???"]But didn't the prince say it was the current king who killed the former king and queen? He's avenging their deaths!
[charslot]
[name="???"]Who's to say if that's true or false? Perhaps he suddenly went mad, and conjured the entire story to appease his own mind, to excuse the misfortune he brought upon himself.
[charslot]
[name="???"]Regardless, he's about to die... The former king and queen, and our current king too, they're all dead.
[charslot]
[name="???"]Is there a point in wagging our tongues any further?
[charslot]
[name="???"]Indeed, what's the point?
Mrow.
The black cat slowly approaches the prince, and sits down.
The prince uses the last bit of his strength to look into those azure eyes.
[charslot]
[name="Prince"]...What do you think...
[name="Prince"]...What I've done, did it mean anything?

The black cat still does not respond, and only watches him silently.

Lucian closes the screenplay.
The mysterious and beautiful creature sits on a distant windowsill enjoying the sun. She does not move when she sees Lucian looking up from the script, but only glances at him with a trace of curiosity.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4198_christ_1#1$1")]

Lucian droops his head in thought.
He looks at the Troupe behind him. The wounds from the river's rocks scratching him yesterday send sharp spasms of pain. A failed escape.
He sings a melody overflowing with suppressed zeal. A choice had already taken root in his heart, waiting only for the final day to come.
The pain is so vivid he subconsciously smiles.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1832_1#3$1")]
[name="Lucian"]...The result is but an answer I'll find at the end of it all.

The moment he finishes speaking, the mysterious and beautiful creature suddenly stands, wagging her twin tails in excitement, as if a long-awaited toy has arrived.
Her eyes light up, a rare sight, flashing a blue as deep as the night sky.

She hops onto Lucian's desk, and with a show of practically extraordinary closeness, nuzzles her head against his, before slowly blinking her eyes at him.
Willful lunacy mixed with restrained rancor, like messy but absolutely enticing cat grass, woven into a furry ball of yarn. She likes this answer a lot, and emotions like these.
What sort of delicious emotions will this story and this person bring her this time?
