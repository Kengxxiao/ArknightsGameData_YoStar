[Dialog]
[charslot]
Hearing Closure's nonchalant response, Robin finally understands just what the anxiety she feels is actually about.
She feels remorse for what happened during their escape from prison, and she wants to one day tell Domma the truth.
She feels bad for not asking Closure for help, and she wishes to one day become someone who can ask her friends for help.
She is thankful for her coworkers' kindness, and she looks forward to the day she can return the favor.
She wants, she wishes, and she looks forward. That is why she is unwilling to admit that who she is right now cannot achieve any of this. She can't make herself like that just because of a single idea.
She simply can't tell Domma, because she cannot cross that hurdle in her mind.
She simply doesn't think to ask her friends when she needs help, because she has little to no friends.
She simply doesn't know how to respond to the kindness of others, because she has never actually accepted their kindness.
These chaotic ideas made her try her hardest to deny her past lifestyle, to the point that she tried to force all this on a little cloudbeast.
But the truth is it might be exactly as Closure says—
