It all happens in a flash of light.
You see the Originium crystal cluster near you explode. Amiya wanted to protect you, but time does not allow for her reaction.
You see the black monster rush over, blocking you both from the cluster with its large, solid body.
You see Kal'tsit...

Doctor, do you ever doubt the meaning in your own existence? I do.
I understand my mission clearly. It is difficult, but I recognize its meaning.
As for the future, I believe you will find an answer. I can only persevere in that belief.
Don't spare too much worry for me. Rhodes Island shouldn't be so fragile that one person's departure would leave it unable to proceed on.
[dialog]
[Delay(time=1)]
My hope?
It is to protect yours and Amiya's hopes.
Though our definitions of 'protect' have nothing in common, it's an oath I will never abandon. I will be standing here with you, until the very end.
We are unable to forget the past, but a different future may await you.

It all happens so quick, but you still manage to comprehend the cruel truth.
The foe you all face is incomprehensible by conventional means. She has authority over all Originium.
The bit of Originium on Kal'tsit's right shoulder is proof that she was born human, but also what steals her life away.
Originium crystals begin to spread as they swallow her entire body, only to shatter as the wind blows them away—your eyes fail to capture the entire process.
With strength, comes fragility.
A long life ends here.
She has kept her promise.
