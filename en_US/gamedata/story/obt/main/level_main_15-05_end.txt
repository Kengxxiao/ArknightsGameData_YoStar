[charslot(slot="l",name="avg_003_kalts_1#1$1",focus="l")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]No. The Ægir Academy of Technology put a great deal of care into this delicate piece of equipment—Given their pride, I'll bet they made sure no one could ever crack their Little Handy.
[name="Kal'tsit"]But the appearance of the Little Handy itself is enough to explain many problems.

[name="Kal'tsit"]Both the Iberian and Rim Billitonian authorities have responded to our call. The problem is that once cooperation begins, subsequent developments could spiral beyond what we've anticipated.
[name="Kal'tsit"]In recent weeks, the Ægir fleet has not only constructed ports in Iberia, but also established landing sites along the southern coast of Rim Billiton.
[name="Kal'tsit"]The Ægirs from the deep sea made no immediate move to land. Instead, they quickly carried out a number of operations, including hydrographic surveying, under the banner of 'technical cooperation'.
[name="Kal'tsit"]They also quickly assembled a 'Land Patrol' through a mix of hired personnel and official partnerships, relying on more neutral intermediaries to facilitate cooperation with land-based forces.

[name="Kal'tsit"]No, I am more inclined to believe that someone took advantage of the internal conflicts within Ægir.
[name="Kal'tsit"]The Land Patrol near the Iberian border, the mining ship being handed off in Rim Billiton, the mercenaries on the Kazdelian frontier...
[name="Kal'tsit"]The breadth of their deployments and the depth of their knowledge about Rhodes Island's classified missions—that's more than enough to prove that Ægir isn't behind this.
