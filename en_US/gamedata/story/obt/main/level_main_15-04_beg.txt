[name="Hierda"]I really don't know either.
[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
Aboard this strange, colossal vessel called 'Rhodes Island,' the Cautus can barely feel the passage of time.
It makes her uneasy. Ever since the day she became Infected, time has meant everything to her.
Time will bring her death—and perhaps, liberation.
However, the beings who dwell in this strange place—yet deny they are gods—seem utterly indifferent to it.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1719_1#4$1")]
[name="Hierda"]Maybe it's because I've never been afraid of dying. Death is nothing more than a passage to a new environment.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1719_1#2$1")]
[name="Hierda"]A pessimist? I don't think so.
[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
The Cautus blurts it out, and regrets it—just a little. She had agreed with many of the clergy's arguments back during those debates… but now that she's here, does she still need to think in those terms?
Does she really care about everything she experienced before the collapse?
After all, even time has forsaken her now.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1719_1#1$1")]
[name="Hierda"]I once worked in a mine that seemed to be endless. To maintain efficiency, the overseer would kill or drive off any bothersome Originium slugs.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1725_1#1$1")]
[name="Raydistorter"]Originium slugs? A mine?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1719_1#1$1")]
[name="Hierda"]Yes. Those Originium slugs are even weaker than me, and the mines... the mines were once my home.
[name="Hierda"]But the overseer didn't expect that the kindest worker in the mine was secretly feeding and caring for the Originium slugs they were trying to drive away—which only drew more of them into the mine.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1719_1#10$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1719_1#1$1")]
[name="Hierda"]The slugs' secretions fed me.
[name="Hierda"]In such a harsh environment, many of them lived short lives, yet new ones kept being born. They gave me strength—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1725_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1719_1#10$1")]
[name="Hierda"]I don't understand. You've shown me so many individuals, each starkly distinct from the next… You all feel love and hate just as we do—and yet, are still vastly different from each other.

[charslot(slot = "m", focus = "n")]
But why have I come here?
The Cautus ponders this question, but her intuition tells her the answer lies with the person who just extended a hand to her.
She looks out the porthole at the top of the cabin into the cold, silent, endless expanse of space. The light from the distant, giant sphere once again passes over the dead planet, piercing the Cautus's eyes.
However, despite her blurry vision, she spots a small silhouette within the light.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1719_1#1$1")]

[name="Hierda"]Is that the one I'm looking for?
