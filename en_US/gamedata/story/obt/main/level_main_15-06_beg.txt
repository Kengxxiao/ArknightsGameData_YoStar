[name="Hierda"]Did you just say my name?

As the Cautus passes by the porthole, she sees the figure out in the darkness of space slowly approach the ship, then disappear from her sights.

[name="Raydistorter"]There's not many of us who like her!
[name="Raydistorter"]Sorry, traveler, I simply can't handle being in the same room as her.

When the bewildered Cautus snaps out of it, she finds herself the only person in the cabin. Upon foreseeing the arrival of an unwelcome soul, everyone else had made themselves scarce.

[name="Mysterious Elf"]No need to look so amazed. I learned how to communicate using long-distance resonance a while ago.
[name="Mysterious Elf"]At the very least, before destroying that odd race, I kept the unique language patterns they had evolved.

[name="Mysterious Elf"]Do you detest destruction as well, our newly-come guest?

[name="Hierda"]I... am not too sure what happened, to be honest.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1720_1#1$1")]
[name="Mysterious Elf"]It's nothing too complicated. My people once ate stars to live. Others may hate us for it, but it's simply our survival instinct at work.
[name="Mysterious Elf"]But now, that past only exists in horror stories passed around the metaphorical campfire.
[name="Mysterious Elf"]My people are on the brink of extinction. I fear I may be the last of my kind, in fact.
[name="Mysterious Elf"]We destroy to live, but when true destruction finally bears down upon us, we are powerless in the face of it...
[name="Mysterious Elf"]From that point onwards, I have become nothing more than a beggar. With the aid of some geniuses, I have changed the method I use to obtain the energy I need to live—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1719_1#1$1")]
[name="Hierda"]It sounds like... You've been trying to blend in with other lifeforms too.
[name="Hierda"]So when you were out in space looking at that dead planet, were you reminiscing about the destruction you experienced?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1720_1#1$1")]
[name="Mysterious Elf"]Reminiscing?
[name="Mysterious Elf"]Haha, nothing of the sort.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1720_1#3$1")]
[name="Mysterious Elf"]Everyone here has accepted the ruination chasing us with serenity and hope in their hearts.
