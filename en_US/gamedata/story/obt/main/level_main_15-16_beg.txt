[name="Misery"]What... is this?
A massive machine emerges in the endless white noise—
All present are familiar with the components that make up its frame.
Closure has often showed off the parts that she used to modify Rhodes Island's modules. Some of them were made by the elite operators themselves.
[name="Touch"]PRTS has repurposed and weaponized Rhodes Island's facilities.
[name="Touch"]But where did they come from? They weren't supposed to be in the Abyss...
[name="Ascalon"]Originium.
Originium shards scatter irregularly across the unusual machine.
No longer do they simply consume; now, they are creating.
[name="Misery"]Are you telling me Originium can recreate the stuff that's on Rhodes Island?
Logos is reminded of the tower in the Assimilated Universe, and of 'her'.
[name="Logos"]It's not that simple.
[name="Logos"]PRTS does not have the capability to decode Originium data. Someone else is intervening.
[name="Ascalon"]Priestess.
[name="Raidian"]Its data is connected to the core of PRTS in a way that I can't understand. These things are different from the Originium entities that we faced!
[name="Blaze"]Looks like we're in for a fight.
[name="Stormeye"]I see no other way.
