We peruse and interpret the past and future of our civilization, as a monk seeks a revelation from his god.
Humans enjoy talking about the possible futures for their civilization, do they not?
At first, we flaunted what little vestige of truth we managed to grasp, and attempted to converse with the 'gods'.
We were answered with silence.
Then, we began to observe the fates of our own kind—
Some were less advanced than us, some slightly more so... in the end, what we learned was that death was the inevitable end of all the creations of nature.
And so humanity inferred that this was the revelation the gods never spoke.
[name="Gentle Voice"]In an instant, we thought we had grasped the truth of the universe.
[name="Gentle Voice"]We carefully 'monopolized' the revelation gained through sacrifice, and preached the inevitability of doom with so-called optimism.
[name="Gentle Voice"]'Death is the inevitable end of all the creations of nature. All we can do is to leave behind the truth before our doom.'
[name="Gentle Voice"]You've lived on that ship for some time, and come to know some adorable lifeforms. Do you agree with this assessment?
[name="Hierda"]You don't agree with the Presence?
[name="Gentle Voice"]I respect them.
[name="Gentle Voice"]They were great people, but most of them were simply fools slightly smarter than the others.
[name="Hierda"]Why are you asking me this? And... why have you brought me here?
[name="Hierda"]We were in that corridor just a moment ago.
[name="Gentle Voice"]Here or there, it makes no difference.
[name="Gentle Voice"]You have too many questions, questions that this place can answer.
[name="Hierda"]What is this place?
[name="Gentle Voice"]The graveyard of civilization's memory.

Towering statues made of unknown materials stand upon the vast expanse.
Ripples spread outwards in every direction, up towards the sky beyond the dark clouds, and down towards the grey-white ground.
[name="Gentle Voice"]Out in the vastness of the universe, civilization was born, like a drop of water falling into the ocean, leaving ripples in its wake.
[name="Gentle Voice"]They cross paths, love, hate, and eventually die.
[name="Gentle Voice"]The ripples of dead civilizations are forever etched upon this tombstone. Even after the bright stars of the forebears who inspired so many that came after them are long gone—
[name="Gentle Voice"]They still leave behind an incomparable impact on the universe. It is the ripples they left behind that form this land upon which we stand.
[name="Gentle Voice"]Their legacy fosters new civilizations, which in turn leave their own traces upon the universe.
[name="Hierda"]But it seems... broken? Like a tree trunk snapped in half.
[name="Gentle Voice"]You're not the first to describe it that way.
[name="Gentle Voice"]Once, someone very important to me said the same.
[name="Gentle Voice"]An absolute, ultimate presence tirelessly reaps the branches that sprout from this poor trunk, yet we know nothing about It.
[name="Hierda"]What you've shown me is like... a miracle...
[name="Hierda"]You saved me... from disintegration...
[name="Hierda"]...God.
[name="Gentle Voice"]'God'?

Then, a faint light breaks through a crack in the clouds. Looking upon the light, masses of people cheer and exclaim.
The Cautus feels as though she were among those masses.
[name="Hierda"]I'm witnessing—
[name="Priestess"]History.
Then, the ray of light bursts into a rainbow spectrum, as though the universe were painting upon a black canvas.
[name="Priestess"]In their last moments, the pious souls continued to pray to the mysterious blessing of the universe.
[name="Priestess"]The people of reason, the scientists, they boarded their flying machines and flew into the light, hoping to touch the truth up close.
[name="Hierda"](There's no movement? Why isn't anything happening, now that they've gone into the light?)
[name="Priestess"]The idealists, the conservatives, denounced the enemy for invading the space that had belonged to them from their first moment of sentience.
[name="Priestess"]They brashly directed their most dangerous weapons towards the prismatic sky.
The gentle light accepted all, neither exploding nor fighting back.
The light followed its determined path, ignoring the agitated souls beneath, though chaos and death had already begun to spread amongst them.
[name="Hierda"]W-What's happening?
[name="Priestess"]Do you want to go into the light?
[name="Hierda"]...?!
The Cautus feels her vision climb upwards, over the agitated crowd, over the burning mountains, over the dark clouds.
She can almost reach out and touch the rainbow light.
Weapons powerful enough to destroy an entire planet fly past her into the light without a sound. Ships that can sail the stars fall powerlessly to the ground.
[name="Priestess"]They resisted.
[name="Priestess"]They prayed.
[name="Priestess"]They tried to sway the cold light with all things bright and beautiful that they had created over millennia—
[name="Priestess"]But the light was unwavering, cold like deep space.
[name="Priestess"]The light passed over the planet and left. All was silent.
The Cautus finds herself gazing into deep space, at the broken remains of the celestial body.
It is like the sight that the Presence was gazing at, that she was curious about, when she gazed upon the Presence.
[name="Hierda"]It's... all gone... why?
From whence did the doom come? Why did it come? Did it leave? Where did it go? What happened to all the lives—
Then she sees it.
Only broken remains are left upon the ruined surface of the planet, when the light of the star once again shines upon it. The planetary fragments break through the bonds of gravity and scatter to infinite space.
[name="Priestess"]It was once a flourishing civilization that marked those fragments.
[name="Priestess"]No one could ever be prepared for It.
[name="Priestess"]Even the wisest, most knowledgeable sages of this civilization had hoped for some premonition, some warning before the coming of the doom.
[name="Priestess"]Unfortunately...
The Cautus witnessed the death of the gods, the powerlessness of the gods. For a moment, she even forgot how to fear.
[name="Hierda"]Is this... the history that you experienced?
[name="Priestess"]No. It's simply one of countless fragments that we captured.
[name="Priestess"]This single glimpse could hardly compare to what I experienced for myself.

[name="Priestess"]Anywhere, perhaps even another destroyed planet, the marks of a lost civilization still etched upon it.
The gravity of the dead planet begins to draw in guests from deep space, and it begins to be made whole again.
[name="Hierda"]Those ships floating in deep space—
[name="Priestess"]Explorers, seekers, colonizers, perhaps even plunderers, coming from far away.
