[name="Mechanist"]*cough* *cough* Thanks for the barrier. A life-saver.
[name="Mechanist"]Are you sure that Originium circuit has been properly set? I've checked it three times. It shouldn't fail...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4133_logos_1#1$1")]
[name="Logos"]No semantical deviation. The circuit conforms to the simulations.
[name="Logos"]There should not have been any error.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_521_1#1$1")]
[name="Mechanist"]How about another possibility... it's not we who are wrong?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4133_logos_1#1$1")]
[name="Logos"]There are no flaws in the blueprint produced by the Doctor and Dr. Kal'tsit. The incantation simulation is effective.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_521_1#1$1")]
[name="Mechanist"]What I mean is that there's something wrong with the material used in the Originium Arc itself!
[name="Mechanist"]I seem to remember that Closure kept some good stuff in the warehouse—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4133_logos_1#8$1")]
[name="Logos"]Bad idea. We've made enough of a mess in the Engineering Department as it is.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_521_1#1$1")]
[name="Mechanist"]Well, we're doing it on the orders of the Doctor and Dr. Kal'tsit!
