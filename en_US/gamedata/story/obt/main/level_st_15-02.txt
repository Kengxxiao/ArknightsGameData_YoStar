Theresis falls in the ocean of information. The massive quantity buffets him, assimilating his cognition.
He can feel his mind grow slow, but he still tries to follow the guidance left behind by Theresa—
Guided by his sword, the information flow reconstructed by Theresa clashes with the preexisting one.
[PlaySound(key="$d_avg_seacitysurface", volume=1)]
The massive collision lasts only an instant.
The surface begins to surge. Then, the sea splits open, as if sliced by a sharp blade.
A dark abyss appears in the Assimilated Universe. The sea of data stirs and roils.
Waves crashing against waves, drowning out one another.
Even as his mind grows numb, Theresis can sense the will gazing upon him weaken rapidly.

Theresis observes his surroundings. He is certain that he is still inside Originium.
The nature of what makes up this place is no different from the tower that Theresa weaved—it is information reconstructed.
Theresa has left him the key. He is sure he can put an end to this enigma.

[name="Priestess"]In the language of Originium, reality and falsehood are not polar opposites.

[name="Priestess"]<i>It.</i>
[name="Priestess"]{@nickname} once had hope for the beings on this land... guiding them to evolve and seek hope through Originium, giving them a chance to face It, perhaps even overcome It.
[name="Priestess"]But they are doomed to despair.
[name="Priestess"]'Teekaz'. You were not part of the plan, but you became the species most affected by Originium. An accident.
