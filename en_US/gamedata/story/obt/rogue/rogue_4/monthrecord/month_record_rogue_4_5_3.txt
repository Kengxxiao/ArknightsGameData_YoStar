As Jieyun wanders the Ashoka woods, she realizes what she must do to enter the bell tower before her.
She believes the Seaborn just now had given up its past, its belongings, the form that evolution had bestowed upon it, and the experiences and thoughts it once held dear. All of that had been abandoned. But she still carries her heavy pack.
She asks herself: 'Is this backpack important to me? Why will I not abandon it?' She then immediately realizes: 'I cannot do so.'
'Because the things inside are the connections between me and others. This flower is the name Shifu gave me. I'm very fond of it. This piece of broken porcelain is the Sword Forge where I drank, fought, and sang songs. It's very dear to me. This short sword is the man who is peerless in his kung fu. I now understand why he chose to leave. This Originium is the landship, where I met many of my friends... Along this road, I have come across many. The things they left behind were these rocks, ribbons, flowers, and feathers. And I do not wish to give these up.'
Jieyun now understands completely. She looks all around her, an enlightened smile on her face. The black ring behind her head spins in all its magnificence. Thunder rolls, faint yet present.
'I understand that I should give up my form, my thoughts, all that I have. I understand that I need only let them go, then I can follow my people into the bell tower!'
But she turns, continuing to carry her heavy pack. She turns her back on the tower.
'But I have my answer. I will not put it down. If I must give these up to enter, then I'd rather not enter at all.'
Jieyun takes a step, free from worry. She is now one with a clear view of the road, both behind her and ahead of her. She walks, away from the bell tower.
BONGâ€”
The toll of the great bell resounds across the Ashoka woods at the foot of the bell tower, but the Anasa girl has long since gone.
She still carries her heavy pack, but behind her, the gate to the tower slowly opens.
