Otherwise, you'll find out what I did to your desk.\nAnyway, I'm not writing just to scare you—I'm not that bored.\nI've prepared a gift for the little bunny; she's already got it. As for you, I made you a bowl of fried rice.\nFeel free to toss it if you want, but this fried rice is cooked with the eternal flames from the furnace and my secret seasoning. It's probably the only bowl like it in all of Kazdel. Do whatever you think is best.
