I hope you like them.\nSo if you get hungry, don't starve yourself, have a cookie to take the edge off. That's good for your body and your mood.\nI only had time to make the cream-filled ones for now. If you want to try another flavor, maybe we could make them together in a dessert class?\nAfter all, sweet memories come back easier than bitter ones.\nIt's getting late. Don't stay up too long.\nSee you... in the morning... Doctor~",

I was really happy to receive so many blessings and gifts today.\nYou had already left when we were cutting the cake, probably caught up with work again, I guess? So I saved you a sliceâ€”make sure you eat it.\nNext time, when your birthday comes, I'll prepare a cake for you in return. Don't say noâ€”I know you're actually looking forward to it.\nHehe. Good night, Doctor.",
