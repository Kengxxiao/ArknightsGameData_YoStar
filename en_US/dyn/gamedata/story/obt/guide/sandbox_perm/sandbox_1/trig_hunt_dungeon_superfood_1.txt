[Tutorial(protectTime=0.8, dialogHead="$avatar_zumama")]Look at what we got! These are extremely rare Forever Provisions!
[Tutorial(protectTime=0.8, dialogHead="$avatar_zumama")]The High Priest mentioned in his book that Provisions like these can't be obtained from cooking, but only by hunting Exotic Beasts.
[Tutorial(protectTime=0.8, dialogHead="$avatar_zumama")]Rare food like this can improve our abilities permanently, so we should keep exploring the Feral Strange Territory for more of these!
