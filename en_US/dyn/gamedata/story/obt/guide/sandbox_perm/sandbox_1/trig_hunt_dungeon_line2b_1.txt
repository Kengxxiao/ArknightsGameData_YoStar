[Tutorial(protectTime=0.8, dialogHead="$avatar_zumama")]Hey, we've learned a lot from our last exploration. This region is largely unexplored, and there's a ton of resources waiting for us. We call these areas 'Strange Territories.'
[Tutorial(protectTime=0.8, dialogHead="$avatar_zumama")]We'll be able to speed up construction work if we manage to continuously harvest resources from there!
[Tutorial(protectTime=0.8, dialogHead="$avatar_zumama")]We've recorded what we saw in the Discovery Casket, so take a look whenever you're free.
