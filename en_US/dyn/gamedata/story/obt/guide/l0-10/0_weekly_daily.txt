[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] In order to recoup operational expenses and equipment upkeep, maintaining Rhodes Island's supply line is one of the most important daily responsibilities.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] In Resource Skirmishes, you must complete special requests to replenish different resources.
[Tutorial(target="weekly_layout", waitForSignal="stage_weekly_zonetype_selected",           animStyle="Click", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Tap to enter Resource Skirmish stage selection.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Normally, Supplies stages are only available on certain days. However, during your Rhodes Island orientation, stages in Aerial Threat, Cargo Escort, Tough Siege, Resource Search, and Tactical Drill will all be available to you.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] These stages offer better, more targeted rewards, so please plan around them accordingly.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] It's recommended to focus on Cargo Escort, Aerial Threat, and Tactical Drill stages first.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Cargo Escort gives you LMD to train your operators, Tactical Drill gives Battle Records for upgrading them, and Aerial Threat gives Skill Summaries for raising their Skill levels.
