[name="Papyrus"]I come from a family of academics, so we have a large collection of treasured literature at home that is maintained and expanded by each generation.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Of course, we have books on a variety of topics, but like many people in our city, my father thinks history is the most noble of knowledge.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]As for myself... I'm not sure if I like it or just got used to it because I had no other choice. I might be more familiar with how people lived two thousand years ago than my own life.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_071#1")]
[name="Impetuous Villager"]Two thousand? Whoa, that's like my grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_071#1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Fun things...? Right, there used to be a small number of scholars who speculated that the Manticores were the lords of the rainforest, idols worshiped by all.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]They pointed to a skeleton found in a massive tomb as evidence, but later, more advanced technology proved that they were simply too creative when they put the skeleton back together.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]They put the bones back together in the wrong spots, and made an Archosauria look like a Manticore.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Speaking of Archosauria, there's also an especially famous 'entertainment hypothesis'.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]The reason that the Archosauria did not leave any traces in early recorded history is that their intelligence and technology had already developed to a level that was far beyond modern Sargon's.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]They had already more than satisfied their curiosity, and so they didn't want any contact with the outside world and intentionally erased all traces of any explorers who found them.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#13$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]And also...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#5$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]...Oh, I'm sorry! Once I get into my area of expertise, I tend to go on and on, even if I'm just having a laugh.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_072#1")]
[name="Gentle Villager"]What's there to be sorry about? You were telling us a bunch of things we didn't know. It's fun.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_073#1")]
[name="Stout Villager"]Right, every time I hear you say those strange words, it just pulls me in, like I'm possessed!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Ahem... Okay, that was all just academic anecdotes. Whether you understand them or not, please don't take them seriously...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]But there's really not much more I can tell besides the stories in my books.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Before I made up my mind to leave home and go on a journey, I had left Menat-Ha'mait, where I was born and raised, only once.

[name="Impetuous Villager"]Keep going!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#2$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Okay... One day, I had an argument with a friend over some documents. She suddenly slammed on the desk, and said she was taking me to a mutual friend to reason things out.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#2$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Maybe we were both too agitated, but we didn't even think of trying the professors at the academy... She contacted a caravan, and we left with them.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]At first, I was really scared that my father would find out and punish me for wasting time and putting myself in danger.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]But actually, we ended up staying in a carriage compartment that was made to be like a bedroom. I kept following my routine and woke up at seven in the morning to keep working on my thesis.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Our mutual friend rushed to the closest town to meet up with us as well.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]The only things I remember about our meeting are her taking some scary photos of a tomb excavation site from unexpected angles for me...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]And the weather being so terrible that I kept the window shut the entire trip.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]I know that was the right decision for my health, but I still wonder what it looked like outside the window.

The tribespeople all stare at each other, apparently not expecting the story to end so abruptly.
After a brief moment, right after somebody slurps a fowlbeast egg, one of the audience members breaks the silence.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_071#1")]
[name="Impetuous Villager"]I've got a question. What's a compartment? How did it bring your whole room with you?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_072#1")]

Papyrus finds herself surrounded by the Archosauria and bombarded with questions.
Some are ones that she had anticipated, while others are questions that she had never thought about.
From the library of her childhood home to the magnificent Varjavandabad Museum and then the Rhodes Island landship...
As she answers the questions, her boring life slowly sounds more vivid and colorful.
Finally, everyone asks her about her current trip.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_071#1")]
[name="Impetuous Villager"]I still have one more question, Papyrus. You keep on bringing all those strange trinkets, like saws and stones that tell when it'll rain... Where did you get them?

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]I just think that if the curse doesn't exist, then the other side of the rainforest they're so afraid of is just another tribe. They shouldn't be trapped by their ancestors' legends.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_163#1")]
[name="Roaming Doctor"]You insist on revealing the 'true history', even if it means hurting the ones who are alive.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Just as you said, I can't be sure what will happen when the two tribes make contact. There has been much bloodshed between tribes throughout history.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]That's why I've been going between the two tribes in order to compare and contrast them.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]If they once had a close relationship and still share common rituals, then the two sides would already have the foundation of a friendly encounter.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Uh, but actually... it was the inventions of the other tribes I've been bringing back that piqued their curiosity. Both sides proactively asked to meet their friends on the other side of the forest.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_163#1")]
[name="Roaming Doctor"]So this was not your idea.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Right. Thinking back, perhaps I was just playing the role of a Messenger.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Oh, doctor, they're planning to build a bridge by the waterfall. Maybe you won't have to take a detour through the foggiest part of the rainforest the next time you leave.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_163#1")]
[name="Roaming Doctor"]What about you?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_163#1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_163#1")]
[name="Roaming Doctor"]I can tell your social standing is even higher than theirs. You could've had someone dig up the history between these two tribes for you.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_163#1")]
[name="Roaming Doctor"]It is within your power to interfere in their lives by sending a Messenger to demand the two tribes form ties or even merge into one. I've seen that happen many times.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_163#1")]
[name="Roaming Doctor"]Why put yourself through all this trouble?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]

[name="Roaming Doctor"]...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#14$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Before I left home, someone I really respected once told me to discover the meaning of my journey for myself, and that I should never forget it, but also not think too highly of it.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#12$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]That's why I tried my hardest. Although going by the results, I guess the only thing that I've gained so far is a whole lot of nightmares...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#12$1")]

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]Just as you predicted, the Archosauria are born combative. In the past, the two tribes often came to blows whenever they saw each other.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4139_papyrs_1#1$1")]
[name="Papyrus"]I think... it's because somebody would go missing every time they went to the other side that the tribes slowly got the idea that the forest curses people.
