[name="Eunectes"]Not entirely.
[name="Eunectes"]Here's what I think. The nomadic city of the Tiacauh needs to be ahead of its time. It needs to be incredible.
[name="Eunectes"]As far as design is concerned, I could never compete with Stitch.
[name="Eunectes"]That's why I'm building a living city.
[name="Eunectes"]My friends here, once fixed, will become the building blocks of the new city.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1429_1#1$1")]
[name="High Priest"]The robots will be your city's building blocks? And then?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_416_zumama_1#4$1")]
[name="Eunectes"]Three friends make one large unit, and five large units make one huge unit, unit after unit, until they're the size of a nomadic city!
[name="Eunectes"]That way, you can get an answer no matter which part of the city you talk to, and the whole nomadic city will be friends with the people living inside it!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1429_1#1$1")]
[name="High Priest"]Okay... where will the people live?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_416_zumama_1#4$1")]
[name="Eunectes"]Don't worry, I've thought about it. Here are the blueprints.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1429_1#1$1")]
[name="High Priest"]I'll just look past the multitude of problems right now. Problem after problem, yet somehow it might just work.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_416_zumama_1#4$1")]
[name="Eunectes"]I think it'll work.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1429_1#1$1")]
[name="High Priest"]First, though, you need to tell me what's going on with this shape.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1429_1#4$1")]
[name="High Priest"]It's absolute madness. One domed roof, three pairs of wheels, medical equipment...
[name="High Priest"]A city-sized—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1429_1#7$1")]
[name="High Priest"]Lancet-2?!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_416_zumama_1#4$1")]
[name="Eunectes"]She makes a cute big sister, doesn't she?
[name="Eunectes"]Look at the last page of the plans.

[name="Eunectes"]I've got everything thought out. A supercomputer in the center of the city, controlling all the robot friends.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_416_zumama_1#4$1")]
[name="Eunectes"]I made the connector round so that Lancet-2 can sit in it—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1429_1#4$1")]
[name="High Priest"]What about me?!
[name="High Priest"]Didn't you give a single thought about me when designing this city?! After all the worrying I did for your sake?!
[name="High Priest"]You know what, screw it, do whatever you want, it's none of my business, I'm going on a long trip—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_416_zumama_1#1$1")]
[name="Eunectes"]Your room's here, High Priest.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1429_1#4$1")]
[name="High Priest"]What's this? Way out in a corner? This isn't the least bit cool compared to that round supercomputer connector! And it's right next to a warehouse—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_416_zumama_1#4$1")]
[name="Eunectes"]That's my bedroom.
[name="Eunectes"]You'll be right next door to me. You can come visit any time.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1429_1#7$1")]
High Priest is at a loss for words. Inam can no longer stifle her laughter.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_075")]
[name="Inam"]Well, how about it? Will you help Zumama or not?
[charslot]
Finally, the High Priest comes to terms with his emotions and composes himself, even finding the wherewithal to give his ridiculous glasses a little pompous push.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1429_1#1$1")]
[name="High Priest"]Of course I'm helping.
[name="High Priest"]First step will be a trip to Rhodes Island on your behalf.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_416_zumama_1#1$1")]
[name="Eunectes"]For what?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1429_1#1$1")]
[name="High Priest"]To ask the subject of your blueprints...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1429_1#6$1")]
[name="High Priest"]Whether the robot who won't even let you drink coffee will let you do this.
