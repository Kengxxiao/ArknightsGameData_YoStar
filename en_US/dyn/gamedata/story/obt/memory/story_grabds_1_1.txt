The wind blows gently, tugging your sleeves like a mischievous child.
It brings many scents to share: the earthy aroma of freshly squeezed rapeseed oil, the crisp freshness of neatly stacked rice straws, and the fragrance of rice stir-fried in the pan.
And so, you know all that is happening in these fields.

The young storm cloudbeast ran a few circles around the truck, leaping up and down.

[name="Stray Storm Cloudbeast"]I don't know. I just took a nap in a haystack because the sun was really warm.
[name="Stray Storm Cloudbeast"]When I woke up, Mommy and Daddy were nowhere to be found! But I could smell them!

The little storm cloudbeast spun around anxiously, on the verge of tears.

[name="Stray Storm Cloudbeast"]But I haven't seen them in years!

The storm cloudbeast jumped into Grain Buds's arms. She sniffed and ran towards the burdenbeast and stockbeast under the red clouds.
She ran and yelled—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4122_grabds_1#4$1",posfrom="30,0",posto="0,0",focus="m",duration=0)]
[name="Grain Buds"]Wait!

[name="Grain Buds"]I found your baby!

[charslot]
The silent burdenbeast seemed to hear her, and stopped in its tracks, turning around to wait.
Grain Buds picked up her pace and tried to bring the storm cloudbeast to the burdenbeast.
But she simply could not close the distance with the burdenbeast, no matter how hard she tried.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_599_1#1$1",posfrom="0,0",posto="0,30",focus="m")]
[name="Stray Storm Cloudbeast"]I-It's no use. You can't catch them.
[name="Stray Storm Cloudbeast"]They're... gone.

[charslot]
But the burdenbeast was just standing there. It never left.
Grain Buds was exhausted and came to a stop, panting heavily. In the sunset, the shadows were stretched long and thin, like lines of ink that never fade.

The girl who happened to pass by jumped onto the truck, into the thick layer of straw. Putting her arms behind her head, she gazed at the clouds in the sky.
The trucks started moving. Swaying in the wind, the straws tickled her face, but she did not mind.
The straw, made nice and toasty by the sun, was like the fur of a stockbeast past autumn, taking her into its gentle embrace.
She felt like she was sleeping on top of a stockbeast... or perhaps a burdenbeast, or a storm cloudbeast.
