It all started in the company bathroom. That day, I was sobbing uncontrollably on the toilet, overwhelmed by despair over my chaotic life.
Outside the stall, a few colleagues who had just returned from a trip to Sargon were chatting about their vacation. From their conversation, I overheard a name and a profound theory that helped me calm down.
And so I packed my bags and traveled from the steel jungles of Columbia to the dense rainforests of Sargon, braving countless hardships along the way. Eventually, I arrived here and met the sage.

[name="Sage's Attendant"]Our other plan was to have you disappear in a flock of fowlbeasts. The problem with that one was you'd end up covered in poop.
[charslot(slot = "middle", name = "avg_4062_totter_1#1$1")]
[name="Totter"]Okay, you made the right choice.

[name="Totter"]I just hope that once I'm gone, my 'grand finale' will be enough to keep drawing a steady stream of tourists.

[name="Sage's Attendant"]To be honest, the rainforest is huge. There must be somewhere you can stay and rest. You don't need to leave.

[name="Sage's Attendant"]I promise that future visitors will not disturb your peace. We'll also pay for your food and clothing. If you need anything, just say the word.

[name="Totter"]No. I still plan on leaving.

[name="Sage's Attendant"]Maybe everyone else sees me as a slick talker, but we grew up together—you know I wouldn't lie to you.
[charslot(slot = "middle", name = "avg_4062_totter_1#1$1")]
[name="Totter"]I know. I'm not stupid.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_070",focus="m")]
[name="Sage's Attendant"]...Then why?
[charslot(slot = "middle", name = "avg_4062_totter_1#1$1")]
[name="Totter"]The sage is right. I should find my own river, the tranquil river that will embrace me and carry me onward.

[name="Sage's Attendant"]Aren't you the sage?
[charslot(slot = "middle", name = "avg_4062_totter_1#1$1")]
[name="Totter"]No. I was just pretending to be him.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_070",focus="m")]
[name="Sage's Attendant"]Everything he said, I made it all up, Totter. It's all beastshit.
[charslot(slot = "middle", name = "avg_4062_totter_1#1$1")]
[name="Totter"]Doesn't matter. I've always gone with the flow anyway.

It doesn't matter whether the sage is 'real' or not.
What matters is that we all have our trials and tribulations. The day we accept that is the day we shall find true peace.
