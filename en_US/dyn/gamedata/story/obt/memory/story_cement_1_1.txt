Shana remembers holding the headlamp high that day, chirping as she clumsily put it on for him and reminded him to wear it down to the mine the next day.
That lamp could shine brighter and farther. With it, he would surely see more clearly and finally crack the problem that had been bothering the miners for weeks.
But she doesn't recall his exact reaction. Was it a bittersweet smile on his face as he stared into the dark of night?
The next day, she was in the mine base looking over some blueprints when she heard news of an accident at her dad's project.
Soon after, her dad's crew disbanded.

Shana remembers searching the entire mine base before finding him standing before the seemingly bottomless mineshaft, staring into its gaping darkness with his hands behind his back.
Not too long ago, he had been surrounded by those who trusted him, their optimism about work and the future infectious. But now, he stood alone, gazing into the abyss.
She stood behind her father, not daring to approach. After what felt like an eternity, she saw him take a deep breath and exhale ever so slowly.
She remembers seeing her father bending down so low that he resembled one of those drills down the mine that had lost power.
It was a scene she had witnessed many, many times.

The miners look at one another, smiling bitterly while shaking their heads.
They take a deep breath, then exhale ever so slowly. They lean against the damp wall and slump down to the ground, heads buried so deep, like drills out of power.
Shana can almost see her father in them.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#2$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#7$1")]

[name="Shana"]I know. It's just... If I leave now without giving it one last shot, I know I'll regret it.

Shana lifts her drill and shield, feeling their weight in her hands.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#11$1")]
[name="Shana"]My drill's still got some juice left in it, and there's enough concrete in my shield to block a few leaks. As for me, maybe...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#2$1")]
[name="Shana"]Maybe I only have enough strength to last another half an hour.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#7$1")]
[name="Shana"]But even so, I want to give it one last try. Maybe if I take a different direction, I'll find the vein. Maybe if I push just a bit harder, we'll achieve what we couldn't.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#7$1")]
[name="Shana"]I always believed that as long as we worked together, with our hands and our skills... We'd find ourselves a future.

The miners begin to scatter, many shuffling back to the cage to wait. Their headlamps form bobbing beads of light in the darkness.
They stop in their tracks and dip their heads to look at the young lady, their new foreman on the first job she took for them.
Shana slings her drill across her shoulder, stoops down a bit, then walks deeper into the bowels of Terra.
Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!
The sound continues: a ghost, as the miners claim, haunting the mine; the warning that urged her father to return. But to Shana, it felt like something else...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#5$1")]
[name="Shana"]Are you telling me to go this way?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#7$1")]

At this depth, Shana feels that she is alone. The odd clank grows clearer than ever. She musters up her depleting strength and keeps digging towards it.

To her surprise, a bright light can be seen from the cracks her drill made.
[stopmusic(fadetime=2)]
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#5$1")]
[name="Shana"]...Light?

[name="Shana"]Why's there light here?
[charslot]
[Dialog]
Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!
As she digs deeper, the light grows stronger, almost blinding. Shana never imagined anything like this so deep underground.
With the last of her strength, she drives the drill downward. Suddenly, the rocks part like pages in a book, unveiling the glimmering ore that time itself had written.
The drill burns through the last of its fuel and ceases its rumbling cry. Shana gasps for breath as she stumbles to check if this is the vein they have been searching for.
A small face bearing a fuzzy beard and a damp nose suddenly pokes out of the crack. It squeezes its mouth though, sniffling as it takes in air.
Sniff sniff!

[name="Shana"]Eh?!
[charslot]
[Dialog]
The sandbeast startles, squeezing its entire body out of the crack, a miner's lamp somehow firmly attached to its back.
It scarpers and clatters its way through the dark mine, lighting up the drill in Shana's hand, the bubbling underground river, and the faces of the miners that it passes.
Thwack! Thwack! Thwack! The headlamp on its back strikes against the rock walls, thwacking as it goes.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_1186_1#1$1")]
[name="Weary Miner"]A sandbeast?! Here? How'd it even get down here? That's the source of our sound?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_006")]
[name="Diligent Miner"]Look there! Those rocks look like they're part of the transition zone. I reckon the chief dug right past the aquifer and struck the vein!
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#5$1")]
[name="Shana"]That... Isn't that the headlamp I gave Dad...?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#5$1")]
[name="Shana"]Why's it on the back of a sandbeast?
[charslot]
[Dialog]
A few impatient miners rush over, lifting their lanterns to inspect the glimmering ore.
[playMusic(intro="$newhope01_intro", key="$newhope01_loop", volume=0.6)]
[name="Excited Miner"]Chief! This is it! It's the vein!
[name="Overjoyed Miner"]It's at the right depth! We managed to break the kilometer bottleneck! We found the vein!
[name="Excited Miner"]We... We did it?
[name="Excited Miner"]We actually did it?!
Shana bends down to examine the passage the sandbeast has dug. Two, five, seven meters...
It dug a passage seven meters long, and in the process, somehow managed to get a left-behind headlamp stuck onto its back.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#9$1")]
[name="Shana"]Seven meters...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#9$1")]
[name="Shana"]Didn't Dad say we were within spitting distance of the vein?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_464_cement_1#2$1")]
[name="Shana"]*phew*
[charslot]
[Dialog]
Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!
The outer casing of the lamp can no longer hold against all these strikes, and it falls onto the ground.
Shana picks up the fallen casing and looks at her father's name, carved by her own hand. This is the lamp she made just for him, wishing him a successful project.
She told him that if he used it, success would surely come, and his crew would have a better future. Even if it was only a glimmer of hope.
The sandbeast continues to rush to the upper levels of the mine, its clanking gradually fading into the distance, but the light shines on.
Shana looks up and sees a sunrise deep within the mine.
