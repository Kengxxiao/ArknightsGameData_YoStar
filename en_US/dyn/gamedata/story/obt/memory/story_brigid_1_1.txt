The Dark Woods allow the nomad passage. One nomad and one burdenbeast, carrying the departed to the edge of the forest.
Further along, at the end of the road, stands the bright city of Na Saoirsí, built of bricks and stones.

There are two small bundles of nondescript flowers, one wrapped in leaves and placed in front of Evelyn's tiny grave, the other tied into a knot and placed at the nomad's feet.
She waits until dawn, just to dispel her lingering doubts. However, by the time the sun rises, all the questions she wanted to ask have lost their meaning.
She can wait no longer.

Brigid stands up with the help of the burdenbeast. She leaves the knot where it is. Her limbs are a bit stiff, both from sitting too long and the bitter cold.
She takes one last glance at the burial mound in front of her, ignoring the sun-drenched nomadic city behind her.
