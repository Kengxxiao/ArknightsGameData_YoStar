Bob, I've given your generous offer in your last letter some serious thought. While I do appreciate your gesture, I won't be departing for Columbia just yet.
We've decided to stay in a settlement outside Kazdel for now, to give our legs a rest.
It's true, we came a long, long way—literally one foot into Kazdel before turning around.
We hesitated, pondered, even argued... but we could neither enter nor leave Kazdel. None of us can quite say why.
Perhaps I still haven't made up my mind.
Perhaps the changes in Kazdel haven't made it that much better.
Or perhaps most of us simply don't have it in us to start another long journey.
On another note, we have a favor to ask. It embarrasses me to say, and I'm unsure if this even falls under your services.
Since this might prove troublesome, please allow me to apologize in advance. All that said, if possible, my friends and I...
...would like some beer.
If a regular supply is unlikely, at least bring some for Sauin Day? We're hoping to join the costume parade and really need some beers for that.

Just like they rather believe that these outlanders are the same as them, having come a long, long back home...
