The two of them each nibble on a piece of fried fin.
The nauseating scent of burnt batter and raw fin is blown away by the night wind, and to the two young men who had not eaten all afternoon out of nervousness, even cold fin fillets carried a hint of appetizing aroma.
[name="Stan"]Not sure if you still remember, but there was one time you lead us younger kids up here, and we spent the entire night playing together. The next day, everyone got a right trashing when we went home.
[name="Feist"]Of course I remember. Granny was furious, since I was the leader and all.
[name="Stan"]We talked about what we wanted to do when we grew up. You were the first one to speak up. You said the factories were driving Londinium into the future, and you wanted to be the guy driving the factories.
[name="Stan"]You said there'd be a day when machines would do all the work for us. We'd just need to pop into the office, press a few buttons, then call it a day—
[name="Feist"]......
[name="Stan"]Er, did I say something wrong?
[name="Feist"]No, it's just that even after all the effort I put in, we're actually further away from that dream than before.
[name="Feist"]Granny was right. I'm too immature. All I could think about was how to make things more efficient, and along the way, I forgot what kind of place a factory actually is.
[name="Feist"]If there really does come a day we could just push a few buttons, why would a factory need to hire so many people?
[name="Feist"]*sigh* If I wasn't so optimization-obsessed, you'd be a fine welder right now.
[name="Stan"]Maybe not. Truth be told, I don't really want to be a welder.
[name="Feist"]Y-You don't?
[name="Stan"]We grew up in the factories, so we all know what a factory man's life is like.
[name="Stan"]You either stand at the line the entire day, or you're clambering up and down the machines to service them. People think you make parts, or weld pipes, but you actually never get to see your own result.
[name="Stan"]The only time I really wanted to be a factory man was the time a lady manning the lathe gave me a perfectly round ball she made out of some scrap metal.
[name="Stan"]But most of the time, her works just went right down the belt before I could even make out their shape. Just parts of one big process in the end.
In the distant factory district, the night shift disembarks from the railway carriages, while the day shift trickle out of the countless factories of Highbury after a hard day's work.
The workers seem nothing compared to the giant buildings behind them.
[name="Stan"]You can see the factory as a whole. You know what everyone's work actually means. That's why I say you've got talent and I don't.
[name="Stan"]You know which bit of the finished product you made yourself and what it does, even if the parts have nothing to do with us once they leave the factory...
[name="Stan"]But I can't do that. To me, factory work's a job where you never get to see the fruits of your labor. You just make the same thing day after day for some cash.
[name="Stan"]The factory won't let go of you, but me? I'm just a welding rod to them. A lousy one, 'just like burnt fins,' according to me Da. They'd throw me away without a second thought.
[name="Feist"]......
[name="Stan"]I know there's nothing wrong with it, really. I'm just not used to factory work.
[name="Stan"]Back when we were little, I never said what I wanted to be when I grew up, because I didn't know.
[name="Stan"]I just want to do something that I can see through from start to end... Something I can...
[name="Stan"]Something I can point at when I'm off the clock and proudly tell people: 'You see this? I did that!' ...Something like that.
[name="Stan"]I don't care what it is. A chair, a set of knives, a sick guy who got better under my care, even a burdenbeast raised by myself...
[name="Stan"]But I was born to a factory man, and so I should be a welder. Because that's what me Da is.
The railcars tug on their whistles as they take the workers clocking out back to their dorms, like the whinnies of a burdenbeast.
[name="Stan"]He'll be back home soon. We should go.
[name="Feist"]Wait, Stan. There's... There's some things I still don't get.

After heading down the platform, Feist returns home, looking over the blueprints he was so proud of once more.
He had always thought of the factory as a whole. It's how his granny does it, so he thought that's how others would too.
But as it turns out, not so.
He thinks of the time he was handling those last few potatoes in the kitchen. He didn't have the least idea what they would become, nor did he really care.
He feels like his impression of the kitchen is more or less the same as Stan's impression of the factory. Maybe even a little better, actually.
At least fried fins and potato pies would make their way back into his belly eventually. But a factory's products? The workers don't have anything to do with them.
Maybe he could drive the factory into the future some day, but what about the workers like Stan, the ones who don't want to do fruitless tasks forever and ever, without knowing anything else?
Workers like Stan who wouldn't even get the chance to work a never-ending job?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4072_ironmn_1#1$1")]

Catherine's tone is firm, and Feist can feel the sleepiness building up behind his brow.
He drags his worn body to his bed and flings himself on it, falling into slumber as the sun rises behind his curtains.
He dreams of Stan mounting a burdenbeast, a treasured companion he raised from a calf. He sits astride the beast's wide back, and with one great leap off the top of the building, he rides off away from the city.
As for Feist himself? He waves farewell, then turns back to Londinium, back into his workshop.
