[name="Herman"]Ah... Ah-choo!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_202",focus="m")]
[name="Waitress"]Oh, Mr. Mayor! Why are you here all by yourself?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_202",focus="m")]
[name="Waitress"]I thought tonight was Miss Ceylon's birthday party?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_544_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Herman"]Something came up on Schwarz's side, so my daughter went to help her.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_202",focus="m")]
[name="Waitress"]Oh...
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_202",focus="m")]
[name="Waitress"]Will it be alright if you don't head over yourself?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_544_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Herman"]By the time I found out, Schwarz had already settled the matter, and Ceylon was already there.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_544_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Herman"]All I can do is wait for them here.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_202",focus="m")]
[name="Waitress"]Well, as long as they're safe.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_202",focus="m")]
[name="Waitress"]Oh, what's that you're holding—
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_544_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Herman"]Wildflowers. Went to the foot of the volcano today to pick them.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_202",focus="m")]
[name="Waitress"]That explains why they look so familiar.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_544_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Herman"]A long time ago, they helped me settle a rocky moment with my wife.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_544_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Herman"]Today, I hope they can help me break the ice with my daughter.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_202",focus="m")]
[name="Waitress"]You've planned this plenty well, so why still the long face, Mr. Mayor?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_544_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Herman"]I had a feeling just now.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_544_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Herman"]A feeling that this little trick of mine isn't going to help this time.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_544_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Herman"]...But why?
