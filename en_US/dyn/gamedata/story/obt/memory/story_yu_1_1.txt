The sky has grown dark for a while now.
A snowstorm rages outside. One would do well to stay inside the restaurant where it is warm.
The chef looks to be around thirteen, fourteen years of age. He stretches out to add oil to the lamp on the table.
There is not much to do right now, but he gives the wick a little pull.
