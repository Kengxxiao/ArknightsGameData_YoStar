Courier has a thick stack of paper in his hands as he stands by the shredder. The first page says 'Kjerag Logistics System Proposal'.
He wears a heavy, hesitant expression on his face, but eventually extends the proposal toward the shredder.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#8$1")]
[name="Bison"]There's only one problem left to solve—the engineering issues in Terra Nullius.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#2$1")]
[name="Courier"]Right.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#6$1")]
[name="Courier"]A Terra Nullius exists between the zone of actual Kjerag control and our neighboring countries.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#6$1")]I
[name="Courier"]A full-fledged logistics system requires a more developed transportation infrastructure, but neighboring countries will not simply sit and watch as Kjerag develops Terra Nullius.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#6$1")]
[name="Courier"]I could not find a way to solve this problem, so I decided to give up.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#10$1")]
[name="Bison"]If I recall correctly, I've discussed solutions to similar issues.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#2$1")]
[name="Courier"]One way is to invest in an international logistics company.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#2$1")]
[name="Courier"]In that case, there's no need to write a proposal at all—just leave it to a developed international logistics firm, like MountainDash Logistics.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#10$1")]
[name="Bison"]We discussed this too.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#10$1")]
[name="Bison"]In order to effectively operate in Kjerag, MountainDash would need someone reliable to manage local operations—someone like you.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#10$1")]
[name="Bison"]But you refused. Do you regret that choice?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#3$1")]
[name="Courier"]Well—no.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#2$1")]
[name="Courier"]Another way is to leave Kjerag and establish my own logistics firm.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#2$1")]
[name="Courier"]As clear as such a firm's Kjerag links would be, it would face a lot less opposition, as long as it does not belong to Kjerag officially.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#2$1")]
[name="Courier"]I'm clear on that much, but—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#10$1")]
[name="Bison"]You're not willing to accept it.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#10$1")]
[name="Bison"]Just like you turned down my offer.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#10$1")]
[name="Bison"]Because either way means leaving Karlan Trade, perhaps even leaving Kjerag.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#10$1")]
[name="Bison"]It's the thought of leaving Kjerag that you really want to banish, isn't it?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#3$1")]
[name="Courier"]I realized that everything in this proposal was written with the assumption that I would manage it personally.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#7$1")]
[name="Courier"]The proposal was custom-made for myself. Implementing it means I'm the one who would need to leave Kjerag.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#7$1")]
[name="Courier"]I was too arrogant.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#5$1")]
[name="Bison"]So you're just giving up on the proposal?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#2$1")]
[name="Courier"]I'll write a new one for the Master, so that he may find the right man.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#10$1")]
[name="Bison"]So you're just giving up on the opportunity?

[name="Courier"]......
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#10$1")]
[name="Bison"]I know how much Kjerag means to you.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#10$1")]
[name="Bison"]But this is a chance for you to show your value, isn't it?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#8$1")]
[name="Bison"]If you're not interested—
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_npc_990_1#8$1")]
[name="Bison"]Why did you choose to study at Rhodes Island?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#6$1")]
[name="Courier"]Thank you for the kind words, but my mind is made up.

Courier snatches the proposal from Bison before he can react.
Before he can put the proposal in the shredder, however, he hears a crowing from behind him.
The fowlbeast is even faster than he, and whisks the proposal away in its beak. He is familiar with this fowlbeast—Tenzin.

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"]It's alright. I thought it was a genius idea at the time too.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#8$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"]Mother always treated you as her son, and I treated you as my brother.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#3$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#8$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"]Why?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#1$1")]
[name="Courier"]You wanted to tell me that you'll never forget the ties that bind me and the Silverashes.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#1$1")]
[name="Courier"]And you wanted to hear the answer from my heart, directly.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"]What's your answer?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#3$1")]

[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#9$1")]
[name="Courier"]That proposal was not the product of my arrogance.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#9$1")]

[name="SilverAsh"]Will it be Karlan Trade's ally, or enemy?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#8$1")]
[name="Courier"]I can only promise that it will remain a friend to Kjerag. It was you who taught me that there is no such thing as an absolute ally or enemy in the realm of business.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"]You think you can persuade Bison to work with you?

[name="Courier"]Between a worthwhile partner and a subordinate whose loyalty is uncertain, he knows which choice to make.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"]My name won't carry much weight outside Kjerag.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#1$1")]
[name="Courier"]The things I've learned over the years by your side and from Rhodes Island will last me a while.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_172_svrash_1#1$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"]......
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_172_svrash_1#2$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"]I'm never going to hear the end of it from Ensia about how I keep driving people away.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#1$1")]
[name="Courier"]You'll deserve it. Of course, Silverash Manor is still my home, and I could hardly be faulted for coming home once in a while.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_172_svrash_1#10$1")]
[name="SilverAsh"]What should we call this company, this new friend of Kjerag?
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_198_blackd_1#8$1")]
[name="Courier"]I think 'Courier Logistics' will do nicely.
