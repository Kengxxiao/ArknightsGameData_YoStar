The shady undercurrents flow beneath the clamor of Carnevale. Yet Leontuzzo, in his coma, is unaware of any of this.
Leontuzzo has a dream.
In his dream, he recalls his long-forgotten past.
The central figure of this dream is neither his mentor and friend, Lavinia, nor his close companion Demetri, nor even his father, Bernardo.
It is not Carracci, who guided him with such a steady hand, nor is it Rubio, who startled the entire city with a single gunshot.
It is an old man.
An old man that Leontuzzo has buried in the deepest recesses of his memory.
Back then, the Grey Hall had just passed the resolution to construct a new nomadic city.
Back then, Lavinia had not yet arrived in Volsinii, and he, following his father's orders, took over the 'family business'.
Back then, Siracusa's rainy season was still a long one.

He looks at the old man standing before him. The old man is no longer as calm as when they first met, nor as passionate as he had been the night before.
The old man just looks... tired.

[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_427_vigil_1#1$1",focus="m")]
[name="Leontuzzo"]You have made a wicked bargain with the victims, signed in blood.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_427_vigil_1#1$1",focus="m")]
