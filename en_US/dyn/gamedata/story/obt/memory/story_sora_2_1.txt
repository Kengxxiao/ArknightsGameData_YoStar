By now, Texas has become somewhat used to the Emperor's unpredictability.
She shrugs, opens the trunk of the car, and freezes for a moment.
There's a girl inside, bound tightly with rope, her mouth taped shut. But that isn't what makes Texas freeze—after all, she's seen this scene plenty of times before.
No, it's because she recognizes the girl.
It's Sora, the pop idol who's become viral lately. Texas likes to listen to her songs when she drives.
As soon as Sora sees Texas, she gives a pleading look and begins to struggle.

The concert that night would later be immortalized by Sora's fans.
Sora, the idol, steps onto the stage and completely changes her style. She sings a variety of songs that clash with her usual image, ranging from folk to rap, and everything in between.
The band initially thinks this is a surprise sanctioned by the record company, so they play along with Sora for several songs.
Soon, the record company intervenes and tells them to stop, but Sora continues singing acapella.
'That was the most passionate voice I've ever heard on this great land.'
'What I heard was endless love, for music, for us, for freedom!'
—Commentary from one of the audience members.
However, after the performance, Monster Siren Records immediately blames Sora for the 'incident'. They threaten to terminate her for 'deliberately sabotaging' the show.
Despite mounting criticism, the usually meek Sora fights back with an unexpected toughness.
She refuses to apologize or admit her mistakes, putting both sides at a temporary impasse.
At this point, Emperor, renowned musician and also a producer signed to Monster Siren Records, steps in.
He states that his company, Penguin Logistics, will take Sora in until she can resume public life.
The Emperor's guarantee quickly smooths things over. For the time being, Sora decides to join Penguin Logistics as a Messenger.
