[name="Pappus"]I was close to the power station before I noticed that Anya had rushed over as well. In her haste to head out to sea, she'd had no time to recharge her pod's power to full, something I only learned afterwards.
[name="Pappus"]We were right next to the station, and the Seaborn had already spotted us. We had no time to discuss things. We had to, at the very least, successfully release the pheromones and lure them to the city.
[name="Pappus"]And so, she snatched the pheromones from my hand and promised she would complete our mission, bidding me return to the city. I got into my own pod. Someone had to perform the backup plan, after all.
[name="Pappus"]Her pod, however, ran out of power and was caught by the Seaborn. The last thing I heard through the comms was her saying, over and over again, that she would hold it tight. *cough* *cough* *cough*! Geh—
