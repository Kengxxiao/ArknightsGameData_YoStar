It seems she too has caught the dance bug as she joins him, and together they dance merrily on the street.

Matterhorn is somewhat incredulous, but Harold gets to work like he's done it a thousand times before.
He starts with a cylindrical piece of wood, measuring out the length of his missing limb, before shaving both ends of the log flat to use as his 'leg'.
Then, he finds a round, flat piece of wood, bores a hole through the middle, and inserts the 'leg' through it. And with that, he has finished his simple-as-can-be 'prosthetic'.
[charslot(slot="m",name="char_199_yak_1#1",focus="m")]

[dialog]

As he speaks, Harold carves some wood into a bowl shape, filling the inside with cotton.
He then puts the bowl flush against the wooden 'leg' and ties them together with rope, finishing it off with an incredibly tight knot.
He stands, then takes a couple of steps before making a circle. To top it all off, he bows to Matterhorn. Mission successful, it seems.
It is a somewhat comical scene, but Matterhorn can't help but applaud.
