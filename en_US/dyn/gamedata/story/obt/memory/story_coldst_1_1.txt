The car trunk flies wide open, and several massive metal toolboxes spill onto the ground, bouncing and rolling into the dust cloud.
The warped and battered locks can no longer contain their contents, so screws, rods and spanners, shiny and chrome, burst out from the boxes, forming a rain of iron.
This is followed by the joyous sounds of metal on metal, tires screeching to a halt on the gravel, and panicked cries and cursing.

Helena turns around. The first thing she sees is Jessica's brow. The drops of sweat on it appeared out of nowhere in an instant.
