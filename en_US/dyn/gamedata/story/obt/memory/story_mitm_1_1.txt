[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4147_mitm_1#1$1", focus="l")]

[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_1457_1#1$1", focus="r")]

[charslot]
Pohl looks around the room. The only notable feature is a blackboard with a few basic sentences written on it, plus some children's scribblings on the side.
There are also a few old, tattered books.
Seeing this, Pohl is even more certain that he has the right plan for talking to the guy.
He rubs his hands and deliberately avoids looking into Hoederer's eyes.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4147_mitm_1#7$1")]
[name="Pohl"]I apologize for the abrupt visit, but I...
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4147_mitm_1#6$1")]
[name="Pohl"]I have a dream.
[charslot]
Pohl chooses to look to Hoederer's face after this statement. However, he reads no notable emotion upon it.
Not much of a surprise. People willing to do things like this tend to be a little eccentric. Perhaps he is just not the talkative type.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4147_mitm_1#6$1")]

[name="Pohl"]Teaching some wild kids in a tiny room like this... you are a dreamer, sir, and I respect you for that.
[name="Pohl"]Sarkaz culture has been lost to us for too long. Kazdel has to learn the importance of writing, culture, and civilization again. And it all starts with education.
[charslot(slot = "m", name = "avg_4147_mitm_1#2$1")]
