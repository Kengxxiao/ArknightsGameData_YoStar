[name="Pelirrojo"]The wedding's tonight, and all these cars are heading there.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4100_caper_1#4$1")]
[name="Caper"]Oh, well that's a happy ending alright. Guess my plan was a success, huh?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1215_1#1$1")]
[name="Pelirrojo"]Yeah, it couldn't have gone any better. I didn't expect you to come up with a crazy idea like that.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1215_1#1$1")]
[name="Pelirrojo"]Hah, honestly, I was real nervous! If you were there, you probably could've heard my sweat hitting the floor!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4100_caper_1#1$1")]
[name="Caper"]But well, now that you're part of them, you can climb the ladder quick. Then, get the punks to stop their protection racket.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1215_1#1$1")]
[name="Pelirrojo"]Uh... Let's not worry about that for now.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1215_1#1$1")]
[name="Pelirrojo"]Hurry, get in! I'll take you! You can join the gang too!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4100_caper_1#3$1")]
[name="Caper"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4100_caper_1#3$1")]
[name="Caper"]Nah-ah, that sounds kinda lame.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4100_caper_1#3$1")]
[name="Caper"]Even if I did join, I'd just make trouble. Nobody's gonna like me there.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4100_caper_1#3$1")]
[name="Caper"]Besides, I'm leaving Dossoles.
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1215_1#1$1")]
[name="Pelirrojo"]Huh? Why?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1215_1#1$1")]
[name="Pelirrojo"]Think about it, Carlie. If we both join the gang, we'll get to waltz right into the casinos, and no one would bother us at all!
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4100_caper_1#5$1")]
[name="Caper"]......
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1215_1#1$1")]
[name="Pelirrojo"]What's wrong?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_npc_1215_1#1$1")]
[name="Pelirrojo"]Isn't this the happy place you've been looking for?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4100_caper_1#2$1")]
[name="Caper"]Is it?
[charslot(slot="m",name="avg_4100_caper_1#2$1")]
[name="Caper"]I don't think I can find the happiness I want here.

Suddenly, the balloons on the bridal cars are all released at once. They slowly take to the sky, floating upwards amid the children's cheers and the crowd's gaze.
By the time Pelirrojo looks back down, Caper is nowhere to be seen.
