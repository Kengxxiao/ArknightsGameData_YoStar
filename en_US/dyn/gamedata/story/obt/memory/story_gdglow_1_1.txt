Susie follows Bean to the Green Spark's front door.
The arboretum and lighting store has been restored to the way it was before the fire, with one new addition. Tucked away in a corner of the pub is a mirror, a barber's chair and all sorts of hairdressing equipment.
The gilded lettering across the storefront glints and glimmers, and the entire store is awash with the smell of a newly furnished building.
Bean climbs up a ladder, gingerly hanging up the Green Spark's sign as applause and cheering break out all around him.
