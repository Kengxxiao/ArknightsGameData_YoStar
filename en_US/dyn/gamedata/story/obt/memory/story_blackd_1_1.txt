In an instant, the trickle of snow transforms into a roaring torrent, uprooting trees and sweeping away boulders.
The avalanche hurtles down the mountainside with terrifying speed, as if the entire mountain is spilling forth. Everywhere it passes, it paints an awe-inspiring yet dreadfully horrifying picture.
It was once the stuff of nightmares for the people of Kjerag, one that they could not flee fast enough from.
This time, however, a group of brave men and women stands firm at the mountain's foot, looking up with confidence.
With the wall of steel that they have built, they vow to challenge this snowy authority that has gone uncontested since time immemorial.

The tidal wave of ice and snow crashes against the line of defense formed by the trucks.
Despite being thousands of times heavier than man, the massive trucks seem insignificant before the power of nature and are pushed back. Some are even toppled.
But the wisdom of man prevails.
Gradually, the force pushing against the line of steel diminishes.
The defense line buckles, but it does not break, slowly coming to a stop a dozen meters before Weiss and the old man.
The avalanche, triggered by human hands, has been stopped.

[name="Old Noble"]She charged into that avalanche on her own?!
[charslot(slot = "m", name="avg_198_blackd_1#3$1")]
[name="Weiss"]Honestly, I didn't expect it either.
[charslot(slot = "m", name="avg_198_blackd_1#6$1")]
[name="Weiss"]But I hope you understand now.
[name="Weiss"]The foreigners are given better treatment because they have what Kjerag doesn't, what Kjerag can't even imagine.
[name="Weiss"]Think about it, Mr. Edwin.
[name="Weiss"]Would you, or those behind you rather get swept away by the tide?
[name="Weiss"]Or would you rather ride it and watch as we conquer what once seemed insurmountable?
[charslot(slot = "m", name="avg_npc_272_1#1$1")]
[name="Old Noble"]...
[name="Old Noble"]Is it too late to get on board?
[charslot(slot = "m", name="avg_198_blackd_1#8$1")]
[name="Weiss"]It's never too late.
[name="Weiss"]Sir Enciodes welcomes everyone who is willing to build a new Kjerag together.

A moment of silence, then the old man nods, if only reluctantly.
[charslot(slot = "m", name="avg_npc_272_1#1$1")]
[name="Old Noble"]I suppose I've grown old.
[charslot(slot = "m", name="avg_198_blackd_1#8$1")]
[name="Weiss"]Not that old. Kjerag still needs you.
[charslot(slot = "m", name="avg_npc_272_1#1$1")]
[name="Old Noble"]...I'll think about it. And I'll talk to them.
[charslot(slot = "m", name="avg_198_blackd_1#4$1")]
[name="Weiss"]We're counting on it.

Weiss smiles.
The old man has seen Weiss smile many times. He knows that, more often than not, it is simply a form of self-defense.
But this time, it is sincere.
Sunlight dances on his face, and his smile is radiant.
