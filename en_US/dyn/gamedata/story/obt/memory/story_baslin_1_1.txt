[name="Michael"]Yes.

[name="Receiving Attendant"]Very well then.
[name="Receiving Attendant"]I really miss that town. The sunset might not be as brilliant as the one in Zwillingstürme, but the smell of freshly baked crullers... There's nothing better.
[name="Receiving Attendant"]I didn't expect you to arrive so soon. I thought...
[name="Receiving Attendant"]I thought you'd at least spend the New Year in your own spire.
[charslot(slot = "l", name = "avg_4109_baslin_1#1$2",focus="l")]
[name="Michael"]True, this might have been my last chance to spend one back in Lupukarn. All the heirs sent to Zwillingstürme to 'study'—who knows when we'll be able to go back home?

[name="Receiving Attendant"]Especially concerning Grimmacht—she's the one who nearly flattened our town. I've heard that if anyone misspeaks, even a single word, she'll slice them in two with her sword!
[name="Receiving Attendant"]Do not take this lightly! Try to limit your conversation to Her Majesty Ewigegnade, who is kinder and gentler. After all, your safety is what matters most.

Michael's palms tighten for a moment. His answer, smooth and fluent, contains a nearly imperceptible pause, a result of his nervousness.
He steals a glance at Ewigegnade, and sees that her smile remains warm, as if encouraging him not to fear. Michael relaxes just a bit.

[name="Michael"]It tells the story of wild beasts that survive by eating raw flesh in the jungle. One day, as they reach the edge of the jungle, they are drawn in by the sound of music from afar.
[charslot(slot = "r", name = "avg_npc_487_1#1$1", focus="r")]

The music echoes throughout the Spire. The treble is lively and bright, and the bass is gentle and docile, as the young Lupo from Lupukarn sheathes his fangs before the Kaiserin.
The piece undoubtedly suits Ewigegnade's tastes. However, to leave an even stronger impression, Michael adds a personal touch during the final tuba solo.
A-one and-a-two and-a-three and-a-four—the band falls silent. Michael steps forward and begins his meticulously practiced (and brilliantly executed) solo.
The solo as originally written was simple and heartfelt, but that wouldn't align with Ewigegnade's preference for grandeur and elegance.
So, Michael adds smooth glissandi to give every pitch a richer, more refined color.
The resplendent Spire of Grace, the colorful silk brocades fluttering in every corner, and the breathtaking sunset—
They perfectly complement the magnificent and masterful performance, creating an orchestra tailored to Ewigegnade's taste. It is brilliant; it is radiant; it is, fortunately, flawlessly performed!
All the preparation Michael had done over the past year was worth it. His heart races with excitement. He slowly lowers the tuba, eagerly stealing more glances at Ewigegnade.
