Oh... Well, there's the bell. A shame our lessons must always end so soon.
Some of you may have sneaked away before the bell rang, and a couple of you are having a nice nap on your desks, but there's nothing wrong with that.
'Commune cum Sclopetis' is a life-long course.
Now, my dear students, you have all obtained your guardian guns.

This is where city guard Ambriel has found herself posted. A wide wall separates the business district from the leisure district, and attempts to hop the wall are frequent.
Her job is extremely simple: stop people from doing so. It is also extremely difficult, for none can hope to contain the free spirits of Laterano.

At this very moment, new recruits to the Pontifica Cohors are marching in formation along the opposite side of the street.
The golden sunset falls upon their guns, the brims of their hats, and their young yet solemn faces.
Like maple syrup flowing across cystymilk toast, like honey drizzling over waffles.

Pedestrians on the street raise their heads, those at home open their windows, and nearly every Lateran in the Pagus holds their breath in unison.
The bell tolls, and several fowlbeasts, their wings a gilded gold, fly across the clear, crisp sky.
A brief silence, then cheerful mirth erupts from the Pagus, carrying the hopes and dreams of its people into the evening air.
