A few rounds ago, Jieyun noticed the drunken state of her opponents. Their footwork was sloppy, and their attacks were clumsy. All she needed was a single blow to knock them out of the ring.
But...
The more the pair fight, the clearer their eyes become. The more blows they send out, the more disciplined their strikes. As if this is no mere post-drink bout they joined on a lark, but a true match in the ring...
Even though they are already out of regular moves.
