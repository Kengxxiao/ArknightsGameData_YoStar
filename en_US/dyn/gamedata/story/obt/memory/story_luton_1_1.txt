Some ugly fowlbeasts circle about. They're nearly as big as I am.
With their stinking beaks and sharp talons, they tear the clothes off corpses in search of food. Sometimes they just eat the corpse. Honestly, I'm not much different from them.
I'm grown up now, so I can force my way past them. I grab the things out of the corpses' grasps. Goods and ID tags I can exchange for rewards, equipment I can sell for money, food I can eat...
Oh, but I haven't found much today. What do I do? I'm so, so hungry...

A plate of meat fresh off the grill is placed in front of Lutonada. Juice drips everywhere, the smell of spice and fat wafting into her nose.
On the battlefield, she would eat anything to survive, even a leather belt. The sensation of a foreign object in her stomach filled her with dread.
At Rhodes Island, she would stuff herself full with their healthy, nutritional meals, and she would feel at ease.
Now, she eats the entire plate of meat, brimming with an irresistible, alluring scent, delightedly. She feels... joy.
But it doesn't match the expression on the face of the soldier when he repeated his mantra of 'I want to eat barbecue one more time'. It's an expression she can't name.
What was it? The barbecue was delicious, but it was just a filling meal. What was the emotion that would invoke such longing in the face of death? She has never felt it herself.

[name="Lutonada"]June 19th. There's too many flowers now, and the office can't hold them all. I've given a few to the barbecue man. He said he would put them in the backyard. I hope a change of scenery lets them grow better.
[name="Lutonada"]I'm still doing my best with the seeds. Some sprouts have grown well, while others have withered.
[name="Lutonada"]I'm still learning the zapateado from the barbecue man. I can't do it well yet, and I'm really tired.

Lutonada has not yet recovered from the bout of dancing earlier. She is still catching her breath, her heart pounding within her chest.
The sun continues to shine, just as the people before her continue to dance. The voices echo by her ear once more, but this time, her mind does not envision a murky battlefield.
She feels as if she has caught sight of three indistinct figures. One holds a flowerpot, one is biting down on some barbecue, while the third is whirling her skirt while she dances.
There is a warm feeling spreading through her once-empty chest.
