Surtr edges towards the furnace. The revenants keep whispering in her ear like unfamiliar distant relatives, but she pays no attention to any of it.
There is a memory coming from the city called Kazdel.
The daughter of a Kazdelian war machine engineer.
The only thing Surtr remembers is a girl with a bruised face sitting on her bed, slowly eating what little food she had managed to snatch that day. There is a tattered photo frame by the bed. The man and woman in the photo are all smiles and happiness, but the girl is not in it.
The girl carefully chews on her food like a small animal. She looks back and forth between the door and the window, on alert for anyone who might try to take her food, but never once does she look in the direction of the photo.
Outside the door is Kazdel.
'I heard I could find a bunch of old ghosts here, who might know what I am looking for.' Surtr raises her head and speaks to the revenants.
'......'
'Hey, is there anyone home?'
'It's been a while since one this rude showed up. Did no one ever teach you to respect your ancestors, girl?'
'Are we related? I haven't the faintest idea who you are. I don't even know if I was born here.'
'Then why would you think we would tell you what you want to know?'
Surtr frowns. 'Old sack of bones... If you do not know, then just say so. Now excuse me.'
'Just a moment, young lady. We may not have any bones here, but meeting someone with a spine isn't so bad, once in a while.
'Tell us something. Your past, a story you like, or even something you made up just now. If it satisfies us, we might tell you something that only your ancestors would know.'
'I don't know any stories.'
'You have an imagination, don't you? Use it.'
'Then may I tell you a story of how I'm actually a Sarkaz king who has defeated a hundred flying super monsters?'
'Of course!'
