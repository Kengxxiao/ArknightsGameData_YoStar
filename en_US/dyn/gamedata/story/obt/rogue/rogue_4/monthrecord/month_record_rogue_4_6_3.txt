He does not remember who he is
Nor from whence he came
He simply wanders endlessly through this silent, colorless, unresponsive, and empty world
Bewildered
Confused
But that is only natural
As meaning has yet to form
...
Then, out of nowhere, comes a sigh; a wind blows past him, fading as quickly as it arrived
He remembers the rippling of his skin in the wind, he remembers 'direction'
He steps forward, towards the change
...
He hears a voice for the first time
In the place he cannot reach, the place that seems to be called 'the sky', there is a faint murmuring
It is indistinct, but he can tell that the voices are many
He wants to hear them with clarity, so he continues walking towards them
From a mass of murmurs to whispers, the voices get clearer
He feels something under his feet. There is now a clear boundary between black and gray
And it is at this moment that he senses himself stepping on that boundary
One further step, and he will fall into that familiar, black chaos
The gray expanse behind him is the road he has just walked—'familiarity,' 'safety'; these concepts make him stop going further
Perhaps soon enough, he will return to his wandering
The voices in the sky become falling snowflakes; the delicate whiteness building a broken bridge at the boundary
Color urges him onwards; the unknown at the end of the bridge bids him stop
As he hesitates, the hum of the snowflakes becomes speech
'Go, go'
'Even if you fall into the abyss, I will be with you'
Companionship—
This new concept gives him courage, and he walks atop the broken bridge of snow
With every step, the road behind him collapses in a cacophony; ahead, a thin layer of ice forms
With every step, the voice grows clearer
It is not the voice of another, it is his own
As he breathes, his heart pulses, beating like a drum
With every stride, his surroundings grow brighter, the colors less muted, and more and more of his self appears
He runs, runs, until the dark is left behind him
...
A wail shakes the universe
...
...
'The baby's out, Laqeramaline! It's a <i>boy</i>!'
