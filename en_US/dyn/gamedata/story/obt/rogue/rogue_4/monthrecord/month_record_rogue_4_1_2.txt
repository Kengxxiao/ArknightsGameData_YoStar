'You say you saw a tragedy in the ritual, and prevented it in real life?'
'It's true, Ermi!'
'But how could you be so sure? You never saw the whole picture. Maybe it was a murder. Maybe that friend of this Sarkaz knew it all along, but kept his mouth shut and watched it happen.'
'I... My instincts told me they weren't bad people.'
'Alright, I'll trust your Djall instincts. So what's your point?'
'Don't you understand? If we can share stories of our past and present with our ancestors, doesn't that mean they could experience the future and avoid harm?'
'Do you even realize what you're saying, Nymph?'
'Of course I do! It's the discovery of the century!'
'And have you forgotten how big a part Tin Man plays in the ritual? Without him, our brains would be fried by the deep dive into their consciousness. The revenants are not a wish-granting machine.'
'But—'
'Even if you convinced my master to reopen the heart of the furnace and restore communications with the revenants, there's no guarantee you'd be able to use their subconsciousness to accurately convey what you're trying to predict and avoid. Even for a Djall.'
'...I can't even try?'
'You'd best just forget about it.'
'Alright...'
'—That said, if all you want to do is communicate with the ancestors, I do have an idea.'
'Really? Thanks, Ermi! You're the best!'
