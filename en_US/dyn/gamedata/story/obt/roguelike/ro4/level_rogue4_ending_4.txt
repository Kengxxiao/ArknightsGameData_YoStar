A debate is like a battle. From the Yanese weeping willows on the riverbanks, to the plains on Kazdel's outskirts, it has yet to reach a conclusion.

Thus, even though these west-bound travelers have seen the temple sitting on the edge of Kazdel, a step away from this story's ending, they still continue their search in their debates.

Among the Sarkaz who chose to travel with Qui'lon, Mudrock is the first to awaken to become Anasa.
She listens to the King of Sarkaz's teachings, and strictly follows every commandment. A black ring of enlightenment arises from her asceticism.
But this enlightenment does not free her. Rather, becoming Anasa brings Mudrock even more confusion—
Why does a black ring follow an Anasa's awakening? Why are the Sarkaz born into suffering?
Her heart turns calm, but the questions only grow.
She asks Qui'lon whenever she gets a chance, but his answers only leave her with even more questions.
Her journey of devotion has only just begun.

As a bridge between the revenants and the storytellers, Tin Man rarely involves himself with how a story develops, but this time he is also part of the narrative.
The suffering of the revenants strikes deep in his soul, so he wants to see if this illusory method might free him from his ancient and irreversible shackles.
Unfortunately, the practice does not seem to bring him any change.
Fortunately, he realizes his fetters have already vanished, since long before he entered the furnace.
How could he achieve enlightenment if he is already free? He returns to his position, watching the storytellers narrate the tale.
Though when faced with an interesting topic, he was willing to offer a few words, responding when the crowd refutes him before returning to silence.

Nymph sees every change. An Anasa's black ring is more an inner recognition than a transformation.
A Sarkaz seems to become an Anasa when they are willing to let go of the obsession with suffering hidden within the depths of their heart from birth.
However... when Nymph opens her own heart, using a key to open up and scrutinize her dust-covered past, she fails to find her own suffering.
Her pain seems to have gradually melted away as life in Kazdel improved.
Nymph does not necessarily want to become Anasa. To her, awakening does not grant any special ability. She simply wants to clarify one thing:
What exactly is this 'self-attachment' deep down in their hearts, one even a Djall has no inkling about?
She is vexed by this.

The enlightened King of Sarkaz enjoys the cool breeze under the trees, calmly accepting the changes of the land.
[multiline]The wind walking by his ears, the water running along the river.
[multiline(end=true)]The soil being pushed by sprouts, the young flame lying dormant in his heart.
Time brings drastic change, and all things eventually evolve. The holy land is close at hand, but perhaps it may all be only ruin.
Everything in this world is fleeting. Perhaps there is no difference between your self and your discussions with your companions.
But Qui'lon continues to speak, to act. All that live do so in hardship, so if he can bring them enlightenment with just a few words—
The clouds disperse, and Qui'lon slowly rises to his feet.

One step before they complete their journey to the west. Will Kazdel—will Katsidiya be the end of their story? Qui'lon believes every one of his kin will have their own answer.
They pick up their belongings, and walk towards the Anasa's sacred land.
If the city can serve as an answer, then let it be so.
