The stories told, the paths tread, all faded to nothing.
Only the twinkling stars in the distance bear witness to their existence.

The Endless Key that should have opened the lock of her heart reappears in mid-air. 'Amiya' takes it and returns it to Nymph.

Nymph is certain that the one before her is still the embodiment of finality, here to put an end to everything.
But she is also still the Amiya that Nymph knows so well, with the same sorrows and kindness.
Nymph feels no fear in her presence.
She had even returned the key to her with that smile the Djall is so familiar with.
What is going on?
All Nymph remembers is that she had accepted the imagination of the ancestors, as she was running out of her own.
What happened in between?
Crack.

Nymph hears a strange sound in her hand, like the cracking of an egg played backwards.
She looks down to find that the key in her hand had turned into a glowing cocoon, black shell fragments slowly climbing up its sides.
In the light reflected by the white cocoon and black shell, Nymph saw story after story:
Death by the hand of man, death by Originium, death by Catastrophe.
These are the stories of 'Amiya', which she has chosen to show her new friend. Perhaps in gratitude for the kindness that Nymph has shown.

This is a moment that all storytellers must face.
Blindly seeking the end, when both imagination and inspiration have run dry.
And finally, meeting their own end.

[delay(time=2)]
Emitting a warm light, the white cocoon embraces the Storytellers gently. Amiya had done so before they even realized it.
Like a little languidness before an afternoon nap, drawing one into slumber.
After that, nothing ever changes again.
Sorrow is terminated. Joy is perpetual. Even death has been exiled from the stories.
'Originium' black as night slowly clings on and fixes it in place, ensuring that no external force may affect the story anymore.
In the infinite sea of time, such affixed narratives revolve around their terminator like moons, witnessing more and more stories join their ranks.
Yet...

[Image(image="pic_rogue_4_47", x=0,y=0, xScale=0.85, yScale=0.85,fadetime=2)]
[delay(time=2)]
Amiya silently gazes upon the half-sealed story.
There are only human-shaped holes where Nymph's group once was.
Their duty fulfilled, they may return to where they came from.
Only the narratives that have been affixed continue to revolve around Amiya.
With their tellers gone, these fables will never come to an end, and so the suffering within will never come.
But just as the storyteller has no power over the story, the story is also powerless with regard to the storyteller.
They may leave, but Amiya will always remain in this void, as part of the story.
She casts her gaze to the distance.

Perhaps, somewhere far beyond her reach...
There is another one, another story, another search for the end.
One who overcame countless challenges, defeated countless foes, and received a message from afar in the final moments before the end.
An image formed from emotion. The subject of the image is familiar.

She had wanted to save everything, but all she could do was watch as suffering closed in on that person.
Yet the one in her mind had broken all bonds and now stands before the end.
She is glad, and asks for nothing, except to give her blessings.
This is what she wants to communicate.
Hopefully, that one will be willing to reply this message, before everything comes to an end.
Let it be the final word on this page.
