The furnace is devoid of noise, without a trace of any revenant's agitation. Like diners sleeping off a hearty meal.
Or like children hiding behind a door waiting to pull a prank on someone.

Tin Man takes out a paper bag one labeled with a fast food chain one can find anywhere in Columbia, and solemnly takes out soft drinks, hamburgers, fries, and other food items.
The furnace's heat surges, and from within it follows a messy mix of emotions.
Curiosity, contempt, anger.
All muddled into one, as it always has been.
[name="Tin Man"]Even the old should give new things a try, right?
Tin Man tosses a piece of beastmeat into his mouth, and then throws a bag of fries into the furnace.
[name="Tin Man"](Chew)
[name="Tin Man"](Swallow)
[name="Tin Man"]How's the taste? Want some more?
[name="Tin Man"]Or would you like some ketchup?
The fries turn to ash midair, blending into the hot current like the perfect fuel to fire up the souls' emotions.
Soon, the other food items are also tossed into the furnace, and the revenants eagerly 'taste' them.
Chewing and tasting are, to them, memories lodged deep within themselves, like flavor itself.
The sweetness of ancient fruit, the saltiness of shed tears. The sensation of eating is pieced together from fragmented memories.
They had almost forgotten, and they rejoice.
[name="Tin Man"]You were caught by that guy up there in the sky and tossed down here, but furnace life as you know it will soon be a thing of the past.
[name="Tin Man"]The stories they shared with you all were merely the comforting stories we tell children.
[name="Tin Man"]But the way I see it, I hope you'll see them as a chance to find yourselves again.
[name="Tin Man"]Maybe their adventure has truly touched you, and conjured thoughts of how you want your future to look.
[name="Tin Man"]I can take you out of there.
[name="Tin Man"]Not as a burning mass of consciousnesses, but as individuals, as your own selves, as my kin.
Tin Man takes out three sheetmetal toys from his chest, placing them at his side. He then takes out a pipe and lights it.
[name="Tin Man"]If there's anyone here who really does wish to free themselves from the chaos, then maybe I'll stay a while longer.
The furnace flames rile up, wrapping around themselves. The revenants have long been difficult to discern from within the blaze, and any soul would find it difficult to liberate their will from the mess.
After all, anyone with a strong enough soul would not have been thrown into the furnace in the first place, used by the elder Revenant to provide energy for Kazdel.
But then again, a long time has passed. Who can say if any of them have changed, or perhaps have found enlightenment?
Tin Man sits at the furnace mouth, silently waiting for his kin to answer.
