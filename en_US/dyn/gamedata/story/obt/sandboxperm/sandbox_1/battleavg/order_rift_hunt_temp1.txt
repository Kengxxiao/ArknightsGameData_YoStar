[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]You seem interested in the Strange Territory. It's full of resources, but there's danger lurking within too.
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]A few days back, we went to one of those places and met some creatures we've never seen before. Locals call them 'Exotic Beasts.' Fortunately, we managed to evade their attacks and come home with something sweet.

[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]This is a 'Forever Provision.' This kind of provision gives you permanent buffs.
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Exotic Beasts in Feral Strange Territories produce Provisions like this, so we'll never have to worry about food buff expiring if we go hunting there every now and then.
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Additionally, our Engineering Department has invented a new kind of hunting toolâ€”Hunting Net Launcher!
[additem(itemId="sandbox_1_tactical_43", itemCount="3")]
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Our original Beast Traps can only catch smaller creatures, but now we can capture even bigger guys with our launcher.
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Though, it doesn't work the same way since it's developed based on a Trap Net Launcher.
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]We deployed some launchers when we were retreating from the territory, so you can use them if you find them. I left a little guide too...
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Ah, right. There're some other things you need to know.
[additem(itemId="sandbox_1_tactical_35", itemCount="5")]
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Rhodes Island has sent over some Assist Gear.
[additem(itemId="sandbox_1_tactical_36", itemCount="5")]
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]They don't need to be actively deployed, and will take effect as long as you put them inside your Support Items inventory.
[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]We can make more of them by upgrading Headquarters.

[name="Eunectes", avatarId="char_416_zumama", isAvatarRight="FALSE"]Alright, that's about it. Let's suit up and go to the Discovery Casket for some Exotic Beasts!
