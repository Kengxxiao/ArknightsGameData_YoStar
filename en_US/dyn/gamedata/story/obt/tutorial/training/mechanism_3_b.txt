New enemy spotted. Seems hard to deal with.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_lava")] That's a Mirror that needs to be <@tu.kw>hit a certain number of times</> to defeat. Your ATK will not matter here.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_lava")] Quartz and I both have <@tu.kw>Slow</> <@tu.kw>ASPD</>, with <@tu.kw>larger attack intervals</>, so it'll be hard to take it down.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_kroos")] It's alright, I'm here to help! My <@tu.kw>ASPD</> is <@tu.kw>Fast</>, so this'll be a piece of cake.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_kroos")] My skill lets me do a follow up attack to deal an extra instance of damage <@tu.kw>without affecting</> my regular ASPD or Attack Interval.
