Ah, a dangerous enemy has appeared. Operator 12F is going to have a hard time.

Don't worry, Operator Durin has a wider attack range and her single target attacks deal more damage per hit. She can lower the enemy's HP for him.
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] \
I see, so Durin and 12F can complement each other's abilities and cooperate to defeat the enemies!
[Tutorial(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
Yes. Jessica, make sure to study their differences after this exercise to figure out their optimal deployment positions.
