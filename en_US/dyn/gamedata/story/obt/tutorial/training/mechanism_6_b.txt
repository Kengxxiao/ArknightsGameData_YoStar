—Ouch. I think my DEF went down.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Operator Melantha has just been inflicted with <@tu.kw>Corrosion Damage</>. She immediately took a huge amount of <@tu.kw>Physical damage</>, and also <@tu.kw>has her DEF permanently reduced</>.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_melan")] It seems like the DEF reduction from Corrosion can be <@tu.kw>stacked</>...
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_flower")] No worries. Whenever under the <@tu.kw>burst effect of Elemental Injury</>, you <@tu.kw>gain resistance to any future Elemental Injury.</>
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] You can check which type of Elemental Injury has been inflicted on any Operator from the <@tu.kw>Elemental symbol</> below them. If they are inflicted with multiple types, the <@tu.kw>most severe one</> will be displayed.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_flower")] Doctor, activate my skill to help Melantha.
